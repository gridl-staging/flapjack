# Flapjack Shipped Product Status

Canonical shipped capability and production-readiness snapshot for Flapjack.
Open and future work is owned only by [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md).

**Last updated: 2026-08-07 evening.** **The console now migrates from all three source providers,
offers a translation-report dry-run before any write, and that whole flow is browser-proven** — locally
against real containerised sources and, for the first time, remotely on Linux CI. `engine/dashboard/src/pages/migrateHelpers.ts`
carries a three-entry `MIGRATION_PROVIDER_DESCRIPTORS` array (`algolia`, `meilisearch`, `typesense`) driving
discovery, submit and polling against the real `/1/migrations/{provider}` routes; `Migrate.tsx`'s
`useMigrationPreview` and the `migration-preview-trigger` surface in `MigrateSections.tsx` render the
translation report before any write path opens, share one request builder with submit, reset on any
form-changing edit, and **gate submit on `hardRejections === 0`**. Measured, not asserted: the targeted
three-provider browser run exits `0` with **21 passed**, each provider driving discovery → preview → submit →
terminal success → browse → served search; the full `e2e-ui` suite exits `0` at **411 passed, 5 skipped**
with every skip attributed and none on a migration path; the 390px route audit passes 3 over 23 routes; and
the SSRF-refusal path passes 4, naming the opt-in rather than showing a generic error. Falsifiability was
demonstrated by changing one expected summary count and taking the red. **This is a capability neither
competitor's console has** — verified externally 2026-08-06: Typesense Cloud's dashboard has no
collection-import feature at all, and Meilisearch's Algolia-migration guide hands you a record loop to write
yourself; neither offers a dry-run. `ROADMAP.md` row `MIG-21` closed on this evidence.

**The shipped-profile backend defect underneath it is repaired.** Release binaries previously compiled the
Meilisearch and Typesense loopback admission seams out, so the opt-ins the console tells self-hosting users
to set had no effect in a released binary. Both providers now use the same production-first,
explicit-loopback-fallback admission shape in debug *and* release.
`engine/tests/migration_release_loopback_contract.sh` builds and runs a `--release` server and passes
**26/26 arms twice** — 4 positive, 14 enabled-endpoint refusals, and 8 disabled/wrong-value arms that assert
**zero source requests and zero DNS resolutions**, so the fail-closed default is proven by absence of traffic
rather than only by an error string. Mutation red was taken through the production admission owner.
**One residual, stated because it bounds what this proof means:** that contract runs in no recurring gate —
it is an explicit `engine/_dev/s/test --migration-release-loopback` selector, absent from `--all`, `--ci`, and
every workflow — so nothing re-proves the shipped binary still admits a self-hosted source. Tracked as
`ROADMAP.md` row `MIG-22`.

**`v1.0.11` published 2026-08-06** — the first release since 2026-06-09 and the first time any engine change
reaches a user by either the OSS installer or the Flapjack Cloud engine AMI, which bakes from the same
published archive and manifest. Also landed since the last revision: `flapjack migrate preview` reaching the
CLI for all three source providers (`MIG-20`) with live Meilisearch preview (`MIG-15`); one canonical durable-writer/atomic-write
owner with per-writer snapshot exclusion (`DUR-3`); a `Content-Length` pre-check that refuses an over-cap
bulk-replace upload with `413` before the spool is touched (`MIG-18`); deletion of the plaintext tarball
snapshot helpers, leaving `FLAPJACK_SNAPSHOT_KEY_FILE` / `FJSNAPE1` as the single snapshot-encryption scheme
(`SEC-G5`); and the loadtest readiness ownership guard reaching every live caller (`PL-15`). Static PEM
startup, ACME-backed hot rotation, mandatory replication-peer credentials, and credentialed-cleartext refusal
remain shipped. The React dashboard is a maintained, first-class surface; earlier "deferred to the Svelte
console" dispositions are superseded.

**A full `Nightly Tests` run went green on 2026-08-07 for the first time since 2026-07-07 — and it was a
manual dispatch, not a scheduled run, which is the only reading this file will support.** Staging run
`31213162105` at mirror SHA `23c15008b`, the first carrying every landed repair, concluded `success` on
**all 36 jobs**, with only the capability-gated `Migration scale contract` skipped. Its `event` is
`workflow_dispatch`; the two most recent `event=schedule` runs both failed, so **the 31-run scheduled
streak is unbroken and nothing here may be read as "the nightly is green"**. What it does prove is that
every repair works together on Linux CI. Separately, staging *push* CI at that identical SHA is red on
three jobs — two dashboard jobs missing a backend env export and one duplicated workflow step — tracked as
`ROADMAP.md` row `CI-STAGING-1`; that red is a harness defect, not a product defect.

**Prior context, still accurate:**
The first nightly run on either mirror carrying every landed repair (staging `31176417863` at mirror SHA
`1db1f8dcb`) returned **410 passed, 1 failed**, with `cluster_peers.spec.ts` and `vector-settings.spec.ts`
both green. The single remaining failure is a Linux-only fixture-teardown defect: `source_provider_fixture_ctl.sh
down typesense` cannot `rm -rf` root-owned container files, a boundary macOS never exercises. **The prod
mirror has not received the repairs at all** — its head predates them and its workflows carry none of the
four backend-start environment exports the fix adds — so a red prod night is currently evidence about the
sync, not about the code. See `ROADMAP.md` rows `NIGHT-1` and `SYNC-1`. Nothing in this file should be read
as carrying current *prod* nightly proof. Open work remains canonical in [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md).

- 2026-05-31 stage note: `FLAPJACK_WRITE_QUEUE_BATCH_SIZE` is now runtime-configurable with default-preserving behavior (`32` fallback). See [`3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPS_CONFIGURATION.md`](3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPS_CONFIGURATION.md) for full operator semantics.

- **Backend API:** 197/197 complete (as of 2026-03-13). The full parity verification is retained in the dev repo's internal audit history.
- **Dashboard UI:** `dashboard/src/App.tsx` defines 24 derived user-facing route patterns from 24 raw `path=` attributes and two attribute-less index routes, backed by 22 lazy page components; the wildcard has no lazy component and `Overview` serves two patterns. No scaffolded stubs remain.
- **E2E Browser Tests:** 57 Playwright spec files: 40 full `e2e-ui` specs, seven top-level `e2e-ui` specs, five smoke specs, four `e2e-api` specs, and one `e2e-binary` spec. The most recent full-suite run, 2026-08-07 at the console dry-run merge, exits `0` at **411 passed, 5 skipped**, with every skip attributed by name and none on a migration path. **The last clean machine-owned joined-proof sweep is older than that and its numerator is therefore stale.** It was measured 2026-08-06 at `05c546ca5` against a backend reporting `capabilities.vectorSearch: true` and `vectorSearchLocal: true`, and reported **59 of 59 joinable capability rows passing, with 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 not-run, and 0 unresolved keys** across all 28 proof keys then registered. **P29 (`full/migrate-algolia.spec.ts`) is green**, and the prior sweep's "vendor-side Algolia credential refusal that no repository SHA can fix" diagnosis is **falsified** — all four hops pass with the canonical credential pair. **That measurement predates both the console provider merge and the dry-run merge.** **Re-measured 2026-08-07 evening, superseding every integer in this bullet: the manifest carries 96 backend rows, 69 dashboard routes, 65 joinable rows and 34 proof keys, 0 unresolved.** The `61` rows / `30` keys figures that stood here were stale, as was the `59 / 59` numerator. **No current joined number exists**, because the only artifact on disk was a focused single-spec run against which the report read `1 / 65` with 64 not-run — and `not-run` is not proof. The report refuses to emit anything when the artifact is absent (exit `1`) rather than reporting a stale value. Both keys' specs now pass at the spec level — the `MIG-22` backend prerequisite that made them red is repaired — **but the join report has not been re-run, so no current joined-proof number exists for the 61-row denominator.** Re-run `cd engine/dashboard && node scripts/join_proof_report.mjs` against a fresh full-suite artifact rather than copying any integer forward; the live claim is canonical in [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) row `JOIN-1`. Receipts: the reviewed private JOIN-1 predicate receipt and the reviewed private Algolia credential hop findings. **A capability-gated skip is never counted toward the numerator.**
- **Tour Video Walkthroughs:** Removed 2026-07-30 — the system depended on an external tool at a local path that no longer exists and had been unrunnable since 2026-04-14. Dashboard end-to-end proof is the Playwright e2e-ui suite.
- **Load & Stress Testing:** k6 suite in `engine/loadtest/` — smoke, search throughput, write throughput, mixed workload, spike, memory-pressure, plus the long-running `mixed-soak` / `write-soak` scenarios and `soak_proof.sh` restart harness. PL-10's post-fix 60-minute Stage 3 mixed-soak gate (run date 2026-05-27) is classified `failure`, while the public write contract remained intact (no write `5xx`, no unexpected write `4xx`). Keep detailed lane status in [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md), with measured verdict/evidence paths retained in private stage artifacts. Large-dataset benchmarking (100k docs): deterministic generator (`generate_dataset.mjs`), import throughput (`import_benchmark.sh`), search latency by query type (`search_benchmark.sh`), k6 concurrent load (`benchmark_k6.sh`), and dashboard large-index perf test (`large-index-perf.spec.ts`).

## Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)

This is the detailed public-sync lineage ledger. Current strategic priority order is owned by [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](../../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md), current open-work state is owned by [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md), and release truth is owned by [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md); v1.0.11, published 2026-08-06 by prod `release.yml` run `31096713795`, is the latest ship in the v1.0 line and supersedes v1.0.10 (2026-06-09). **Flapjack has no users and no customers** — see [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](../../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md). Corrected 2026-08-03: this sentence previously overstated the release's commercial adoption.

May 22 OSS polish wave status facts (lanes A-F) and the v1.0.3 public-beta cut remain canonical historical lineage in the existing rows below; they are preserved as lineage, not as the current release baseline.

| Proof Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Canonical dev source for historical v1.0.3 wave | Commit `1111b` (v1.0.3 release cut lane) plus merged PL-14 fix surface `dbd78016` |
| Staging publication | `ci.yml` green at HEAD for the v1.0.3 wave (see current production lane-state owner in `ROADMAP.md`) |
| Prod publication | `ci.yml` green at HEAD for the v1.0.3 wave with release artifacts published on 2026-05-30 |
| Release closeout channels | `github_release`, `binaries`, `ghcr_VERSION`, `ghcr_latest`, `mirror_ci`, `nightlies` |
| Preserved cleanup lineage in prod history | Historical mar31/apr08/apr15 publication lineage remains preserved below; v1.0.3 is an additive release wave, not a history rewrite |
| Non-pruned stale-file removals in public clones | No new stale-file removal axis introduced in v1.0.3; prior mar31/apr08/apr15 cleanup lineage remains authoritative |
| Tracked-file audit outcome | v1.0.3 closure retained public-sync boundaries; no new blocker leaks surfaced in the published release wave |
| Validator boundary contract | Public status/readiness detail ownership remains split: `FEATURES.md` for canonical snapshot, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for strategic priority order, and `ROADMAP.md` for live lane-state |
| Local public validation before push | v1.0.3 release closure validated release assets/channels (`gh release`, GHCR multi-arch, nightly/staging/prod CI green lineage); release history now routes to `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Known residual (out of scope for this wave) | v1.0.3 intentionally excludes post-tag `[Unreleased]` CLI flag/dispatch fixes that ship in the next release |

## Griddle Launch Status (as of 2026-03-24)

The original internal launch checklist is retained in the dev repo; the public outcome is summarized below.

| Checklist Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GL-1 Replication peer auth | ✅ Done | `PeerClient` sends `x-algolia-api-key` + `x-algolia-application-id`; `/internal/*` remains admin-gated. |
| GL-2 Replication catch-up on startup | ✅ Done | `startup_catchup.rs` — fetches missed ops from primary on boot before serving. |
| GL-3 `restrictSources` enforcement | ✅ Done | CIDR/IP allow-list on API keys, fail-closed. Merged. |
| GL-4 Metering agent integration | ✅ Done | `/internal/storage` and `/metrics` both require admin-key auth. `POST /internal/rotate-admin-key` supports runtime key rotation without restart. |
| GL-5 Dictionaries multi-tenant fix | ✅ Done | Per-tenant stop words/plurals/compounds wired in backend and shipped in dashboard UI. |
| GL-6 Dashboard feature completeness | ✅ Done | Dashboard route inventory shipped: 22 user-facing routes backed by 21 lazy-loaded page components, plus the not-found catch-all. Tour video acceptance suite now covers all 24 per-feature specs (01-24) with archived MP4 artifacts. Legacy root walkthrough covers all 21 pages at smoke level. |
| GL-7 Griddle integration docs | ✅ Done | Canonical integration docs are maintained in `../../README.md` (quickstart + API flow), `3_IMPLEMENTATION/DEPLOYMENT.md` (deployment paths), and `../examples/ha-cluster/README.md` (HA proof). |
| GL-8 Engine polish | ✅ Done | Stage 2 and Stage 3 follow-ups remain implemented: recommend env-var handling, virtual-replica validation/enforcement, and auth `restrictSources`/ACL hardening with tests. |
| GL-9 OpenAPI spec completeness | ✅ Done | Stage 4/5 annotation work verified via both `openapi_export_tests` and `openapi::tests` for recommend/personalization/experiments. |

### What "done" requires before CEO sign-off

1. ~~**GL-4** lands~~ — ✅ Done (admin key rotation live, metering endpoints auth-gated)
2. ~~**Chat/RAG dashboard page** — only remaining UI stub (backend ✅, UI shell still scaffolded)~~ — ✅ Done (`/index/:name/chat` shipped)
3. ~~**Dashboard full E2E-UI stability** (per `BROWSER_TESTING_STANDARDS_2.md`) — latest standalone full run baseline is 318/320 passing; fix the two failing Overview analytics specs.~~ — ✅ Done (latest clean-head standalone browser full proof passed 320/320 at `10cc160`)
4. `./s/test --all` green (~20 min full suite) after the dashboard full-suite stability pass. — ✅ Done: exact-HEAD wrapper verification passed on 2026-03-26 at commit `aa7dd7db61d7e274cdf946ac6dd7d7435c4dcdf4`, with all 14 sections green. That result is superseded historical evidence (2026-03-26), not present-tense status; the current dashboard composition result is recorded at the top of this file.

| README screenshots (dash_overview, dash_search, dash_migrate_alg) | ✅ Done | mar23_pm_4 + mar24_pm_1 | Automation landed in mar23_pm_4; refreshed tracked PNGs were merged on 2026-03-25 alongside the screenshot-gated test flow. |
| Repo URL + path hygiene | ✅ Done | mar24_pm_2 | README/show-HN/tour/deployment docs now point to the public repo or `<repo-root>` placeholders where appropriate, and deploy/sync helper scripts now resolve `origin` or repo root instead of hardcoded local paths. |
| Test stability fixes (Recommendations + analytics-deep) | ✅ Done | mar23_pm_6 | Recommendations.test.tsx network-noise isolation; analytics-deep.spec.ts flexible assertion replacing California hardcode; bundler dedup verification script |
| Post-merge regression validation (pm_1) | ✅ Done | mar26_pm_1 | Full suite green after am_1+am_2 merge. Green wrapper proof at `aa7dd7db` — superseded historical evidence (2026-03-26), not current suite status. |
| Debbie sync config hardening | ✅ Done | mar26_pm_2 | Blacklist → whitelist `.debbie.toml`. Prevents leaking 60+ internal files to public repos. |
| README & Show HN polish | ✅ Done | mar26_pm_3 | Stale claims fixed, Docker quickstart added, engine/README public-ready, FEATURES.md counts corrected. |
| Staging push + CI gate-closing | ✅ Done | mar27_noon + mar27_pm | Fixed debbie whitelist gaps, post-sync hook pattern, staging CI across 6+ rounds. Gate-closing staging run `23671792399` on commit `745a059` completed `success`. |
| Algolia compat hardening + deterministic parity | ✅ Done | mar27_night + mar27_master | Mutation parity matrix, runtime/OpenAPI/artifact coupling tests, staged mirror guards, dashboard readiness contracts, SDK/HTTP contract reinforcement. Canonical matrix in `engine/flapjack-http/src/mutation_parity.rs`. |
| Launch docs truth-sync + proof pack | ✅ Done | mar27_pm | PRIORITIES.md, ROADMAP.md, HIGHEST_PRIORITY.md all reconciled with live launch state. Launch proof pack created. Public surface validated (README smoke 6/6, doc-link validation, live URL checks). |
| Confidence completeness: Stage 3 soak/failure | ✅ Done | mar28_stage3_6 | 2h mixed/write soak artifacts, restart-during-active-writes proof, nontrivial crash/restart recovery proof. Bounded latency, zero 5xx, exact post-restart count preservation. |
| Confidence completeness: Stage 4-6 ops/security | ✅ Done | mar28_stage3_6 | Upgrade smoke test, canonical OPERATIONS.md runbooks, SECURITY_BASELINE.md hardening doc, security proof surfaces green. |
| OSS policy docs + version 1.0.0 | ✅ Done | mar28_pm_1 | SECURITY.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md created and added to debbie sync whitelist. All workspace crates bumped to 1.0.0. Version consistency test added. Dev release script `lib/version.sh` helper created. |
| OpenTelemetry distributed tracing | ✅ Done | mar28_pm_2 | Feature-gated OTEL OTLP gRPC export (`--features otel`). `otel.rs` module with `try_init_otel_layer()`, wired into subscriber and graceful shutdown. Zero overhead when disabled. |
| TODO stub cleanup + HA soak hardening | ✅ Done | mar28_pm_3 | Replaced ~601 auto-generated `TODO: Document` stubs with real doc comments across all crates. Added a dev-repo HA soak test harness. Doc-regression tests for server/startup. |
| Codebase quality cleanup (Round 2) | ✅ Done | mar29 | Fixed 15 error-leaking 500 sites across settings/snapshot/query_suggestions (settings+rules+synonyms+query_suggestions migrated to `HandlerError`; snapshot's local helper sanitized). Removed `cognitive_complexity` suppressions in `startup_catchup.rs`/`server.rs`. Decomposed `execute_search_query` (CC=26 → 8 extracted helpers, orchestrator now ~130 lines). Updated `engine/CLAUDE.md` with HandlerError and suppression guidance. |
| HA multi-node soak harness + CI integration | ✅ Done | mar29_pm_1 | Delivered a dev-repo HA soak harness, Rust integration coverage (`engine/tests/test_ha_soak_harness.rs`), and topology/soak shell acceptance tests (`engine/loadtest/tests/ha_topology_acceptance.sh`, `engine/loadtest/tests/ha_soak_acceptance.sh`). |
| File size guardrail enforcement | ✅ Done | mar29_pm_2 | Extracted 13 inline test modules (>500 test lines each) to standalone `*_tests.rs` files. Split 2 production files (`search_helpers.rs`, `promote.rs`). All files now under 800-line guardrail. Pre-commit hook installed via `engine/scripts/install-pre-commit-hook.sh`. |
| Debbie sync pipeline (wave 2) | ✅ Done | mar30_pm_1 | Full debbie sync pipeline to staging and prod repos. OpenAPI test dedup and helper extraction (`openapi_test_helpers.rs`). Experiment handler refactoring (extracted `require_experiment_store`, `resolve_store_and_experiment_id`, `should_promote_variant_settings` helpers). Soak proof consistency harness improvements. Fixed debbie sync excludes for HA soak harness test and SDK lock files. |
| Cognitive complexity reduction | ✅ Done | mar30_pm_2 | Decomposed 5 high-complexity hotspots: `merge_settings_payload` (CC=35), `SearchRequest::validate` (CC=29), `compute_exact_vs_prefix_bucket` (CC=26), `build_results_response` (CC=22), `browse_index` (CC=21). Each refactored into domain-grouped private helpers. Added settings characterization tests (`settings_tests.rs`). Moved `SearchCompat` trait methods to default implementations. |
| Full regression gate + targeted fixes | ✅ Done | mar30_pm_5 | Ran the full post-merge regression gate across Rust, dashboard, browser, SDK, and Go surfaces. The real regression fix was FastEmbed test nondeterminism caused by concurrent ONNX/model cache initialization; affected tests are now serialized. Proof artifacts were captured in `engine/state/`, and the committed OpenAPI export was re-synced after restoring real browse/experiment endpoint summaries in current `main`. |
| Public doc sync surface hardening | ✅ Done | mar30_pm_6 | The public-doc contract is explicit in `.debbie.toml`; Stage 2 of the v2 doc-system migration replaces the former priorities file with `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` plus `ROADMAP.md`, alongside `engine/LIB.md`, `engine/docs2/FEATURES.md`, `engine/loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md`, and the public `engine/docs2/1_STRATEGY/` + `3_IMPLEMENTATION/` trees. Added `engine/tests/doc_sync_helpers.sh`, `engine/tests/validate_sync_surface.sh`, widened `engine/tests/validate_doc_links.sh`, and scrubbed non-public path references from the synced doc graph, including dev-only multi-instance script references in `engine/README.md`. |
| HA convergence contract + runbook truth sync | ✅ Done | mar31_am_2 | Boundary path executed. Added `engine/docs2/4_EVIDENCE/HA_CONVERGENCE_ANALYSIS.md`, aligned `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md` and `engine/examples/ha-cluster/README.md` with the proven async-replication boundary, and tightened `engine/loadtest/tests/ha_soak_acceptance.sh`. |
| Debbie sync wave 3 | ✅ Done | mar31_am_1 | Published the latest post-launch hardening to staging commit `6166055` (CI run `23818440499`) and prod commit `b7841a0` (CI run `23819698304`). Carried the HA boundary truth surfaces, public doc sync contract, regression-gate follow-through, and refreshed committed OpenAPI export. |
| Nightly CI + sync hygiene | ✅ Done | mar31_pm_1 | Restored nightly Rust CI parity by stubbing the dashboard dist asset, added `CHANGELOG.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`/`SECURITY.md` to the public sync whitelist, and clarified root README vector/hybrid platform caveats by target. Published in the completed public lineage; see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical). |
| Operations runbook hardening | ✅ Done | mar31_pm_2 | `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md` now carries proof-backed startup/readiness/replication/admin-key/snapshot failure runbooks, stronger ownership links to deployment/security/config docs, corrected `flapjack --data-dir <path> reset-admin-key` syntax, and tightened proof citations. Published in the completed public lineage; see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical). |
| Security baseline docs + test coverage | ✅ Done | mar31_pm_3 | `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` and `engine/docs2/4_EVIDENCE/SECURITY_BASELINE_AUDIT.md` now capture the shipped HTTP hardening surface (CORS, body limits, trusted proxies, per-key rate limiting) with focused proof references, and non-strict startup catchup now warns-and-continues on write-queue timeout. Published in the completed public lineage; see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical). |
| Security baseline follow-through | ✅ Done | mar31_pm_4 | Closed the scoped HTTP-hardening proof gaps with invalid-key non-consumption and `FLAPJACK_MAX_BODY_MB` `413` tests, aligned the security docs/audit, refreshed the committed OpenAPI export, and tightened helper-script safety around sync destinations. Published in the completed public lineage; see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical). |
| Runbook parity + admin-key truth sync | ✅ Done | mar31_pm_5 | Standardized `flapjack --data-dir <path> reset-admin-key` across startup output, dashboard auth help, `engine/docs/AUTH_DESIGN.md`, and `OPERATIONS.md`, including shell-safe quoting for spaced paths. Published in the completed public lineage; see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical). |
| Experiment handler merge guardrails | ✅ Done | mar31_pm_6 | Routed `/2/abtests/{id}/results` through the shared resolver seam, added direct results-endpoint proof for store-unavailable plus numeric/UUID resolution, and aligned experiment OpenAPI `500` docs with resolver behavior. Published in the completed public lineage; see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical). |
| Targeted cleanup follow-through | ✅ Done | apr08 | Extracted dashboard experiment normalization/results typing into `engine/dashboard/src/lib/experiment-normalization.ts` and removed a stale server cognitive-complexity suppression. Published in the completed public lineage; see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical). |
| Analytics retention hardening + rollup foundation | ✅ Retention done / 🔶 rollup foundation only | apr07_pm_2 | Analytics retention cleanup is deterministic and still defaults to 90 days via `FLAPJACK_ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS`; durable rollup design, known-answer query contracts, schema/config helpers, and `RollupManifest` foundation were merged in the Apr 15 foundation. Later durable analytics work shipped the rollup writer, query-planner fallback, and certified-coverage retention gate; the canonical shipped status is owned by the Analytics & Insights durable rollup storage row. |
| Test hygiene, SDK contract CI, and query safety audit | ✅ Done with deferrals | apr07_pm_3 | Public CI now has an SDK contract gate, dashboard/browser tests were tightened to reduce false positives, stale test-script shims were removed in favor of `engine/s/test`, and confirmed query/request crash paths now return typed/sanitized errors. The run still deferred OpenAPI snapshot follow-up verification and did not execute the separate search-HA ownership plan. |
| OSS polish wave: lane A repo cutover | ✅ Done (superseded by flapjackhq transfer) | may22_5pm_2 | Original may22 cutover landed at `griddlehq/flapjack`; superseded 2026-05-24 by may24_816am L1 which transferred the engine repo from `griddlehq/flapjack` → `flapjackhq/flapjack` for owner-identity consistency with the SDK family. Old URL auto-redirects. install.flapjack.foo now points at `flapjackhq/flapjack/main/engine/install.sh`. Historical detail retained in private stage evidence. |
| OSS polish wave: lane B nightly CI | ✅ Done with deferred-op | may22_5pm_3 | `engine/rust-toolchain.toml` pinned to 1.95.0 and added to `.debbie.toml` `[sync].files`. Nightly workflow JS/Go/server-backed SDK jobs realigned with CI owner parity (shared server artifact, JS workspace flow, Go unit/e2e split). Stages 1–3 complete; Stages 4–5 (3 consecutive green nightly runs on `griddlehq/flapjack`) marked `@work:deferred-op` and never dispatched after cutover. |
| OSS polish wave: lane C README polish | ✅ Done | may22_5pm_4 | 9-stage audit covering root + engine READMEs, CONTRIBUTING audit-and-extend, SECURITY disclosure-path audit, `engine/LIB.md` architecture refresh, CHANGELOG v1.0.0 fidelity, SDK README cleanup, root clutter sweep, and consolidated outbound-link gate. |
| OSS polish wave: lane D docs + demo | ✅ Done | may22_5pm_5 | docs.flapjack.foo + flapjack-demo + apex `flapjack-website` redeployed via Cloudflare Pages. Stage 1 audit froze the docs owner; Stage 2 corrected launch-link sources in `website/index.html` + `engine/demo-dualclient`; Stage 3–4 deployed docs/demo/apex from selected owners; Stage 5 ran the sitemap-first URL audit with ≥10-URL + zero-non-2xx/3xx gate. |
| OSS polish wave: lane E SDK release | ✅ Done (publishes landed across canonical owners) | may22_5pm_6 | Stage 1 topology audit correctly stopped this lane from publishing from the dev mirror; canonical owners later shipped: PyPI `flapjack-search==1.0.0` (may23 Lane 7), Go `github.com/flapjackhq/flapjack-search-go/v4@v4.0.0` (may23 Lane 9), npm `flapjack-search@1.0.0` + 6 scoped packages (2026-05-24 via OIDC Trusted Publishing from `flapjackhq/flapjack-search-javascript` `release.yml`; sigstore provenance log entries `1626399336`–`1626400381`). |
| OSS polish wave: lane F e2e validation | ✅ Done (all 3 gaps closed) | may22_5pm_7 | 8-stage cross-platform validation evidence is retained in private stage artifacts. Final closure: (Stage 1 GHCR arm64) v1.0.1 multi-arch shipped to `ghcr.io/griddlehq/flapjack` in may23 Lane 5 and retagged to `ghcr.io/flapjackhq/flapjack` on 2026-05-24 (`docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/flapjackhq/flapjack:1.0.1` shows linux/amd64+linux/arm64); (Stage 5 faceting) `pass=12 fail=0` broader + `pass=6 fail=0` focused; (Stage 6 SDK registry) Python 1.0.0 (may23 L7), Go v4.0.0 (may23 L9), npm 1.0.0 + 6 scoped packages (2026-05-24 OIDC). |
| may24_816am batch: flapjackhq transfer + RF planning baselines + npm 1.0.0 | ✅ Done | may24_816am | (L1 `d1e30589`) engine repo transferred `griddlehq/flapjack` → `flapjackhq/flapjack`; (L3 `3bdcdffe`) Wave 2 RF-2 analytics rollup build note retained in private stage evidence; (L4 `1283eb7e`) Wave 3 RF-1 HA design detail retained in private ADR evidence + red ha_contracts test baseline (`engine/tests/ha_contracts/c[1-5]_*.rs`); (wrap-up `a2a9feca`) owner-drift sweep; (post-wrap 2026-05-24) GHCR multi-arch retagged to flapjackhq namespace via `docker buildx imagetools create`, npm published via OIDC Trusted Publishing on `flapjackhq/flapjack-search-javascript` (provenance entries `1626399336`–`1626400381`). Wave 2 + Wave 3 dispatched against this baseline. |

## Shipped Feature Status

All shipped capability status lives in the feature tables below (Search, Indexing, Analytics, etc.) through the Production-Readiness tiers. `ROADMAP.md` and `engine/README.md` must link here instead of duplicating feature/readiness inventories.

## Search

## High Availability

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dead-node auto-heal | ✅ Bounded / default-off | Opt-in with `FLAPJACK_AUTOHEAL_ENABLED=true`. The engine evicts at most one sustained-unreachable peer after the fixed three-observation threshold only when the local quorum guard remains satisfied, records refusals/evictions/readmissions in `${FLAPJACK_DATA_DIR}/autoheal_decisions.jsonl`, readmits returning healthy candidates with startup catch-up before authoritative reads, and exposes `autoheal_enabled` plus `autoheal_peers` on admin-only `/internal/cluster/status`. See [Dead-node auto-heal](3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md#scenario-dead-node-auto-heal) and [Replication configuration](3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPS_CONFIGURATION.md#replication). Excludes consensus, majority writes, arbitrary partition healing, simultaneous majority-loss recovery, UI workflow, and CRD/controller lifecycle management. |

## Indexing & Records

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Schemaless JSON upload | ✅ | Dual-field schema (search + filter), nested objects via dot notation |
| `flapjack ingest` beta | ✅ | Streams JSON arrays, NDJSON files, and stdin-backed NDJSON/JSON into the authenticated `/1/indexes/{indexName}/batch` path. Upsert is the only durable mode; explicit `_action:"delete"` records delete by `objectID`. Source-side omissions do not delete target-only records. |
| Atomic bulk-replace job API | ✅ Node-local | Admin-authenticated `POST /1/migrations/bulk-replace?indexName=...` streams NDJSON into the durable migration spool and publishes one replacement generation atomically. Durable status and cooperative cancellation use `/1/migrations/bulk-replace/{jobID}`. Admission returns `503 migration_ha_unsupported` whenever replication peers are configured. |
| Single record CRUD | ✅ | |
| Batch operations | ✅ | Up to 1000 ops, hybrid batching (10 ops or 100ms) |
| Browse (full index scan) | ✅ | Cursor-based pagination |
| deleteByQuery | ✅ | |
| partialUpdateObjects | ✅ | |
| Index copy / move / clear | ✅ | |
| Replicas | ✅ | Virtual + standard replicas |
| Task status API | ✅ | Async task tracking |
| Fail-closed durable acknowledgement | ✅ | A write is never acknowledged before it is recoverable, and a write rejected to the client never becomes visible after restart. The direct oplog-append I/O failure class is proven by `engine/src/index/write_queue_tests.rs::oplog_append_io_failure_before_acknowledgement_is_fail_closed`, which flushes and syncs a partial task-tagged row inside `OpLog::append_operations_with_task_id` *before* `current_seq` advances and then requires one of exactly two honest outcomes: client failure with no replayable state after restart, or an honest durable acknowledgement with the documents present. Compensation stays single-owned by `compensate_failed_commit_batch` → `compensate_uncommitted_tasks` → `OpLog::retract_tasks_from`; no second rollback owner was added (2026-08-02). Receipt: [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_2_durable_ack_fail_closed_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_2_durable_ack_fail_closed_receipt.md). The separate disk-exhaustion fill instance is tracked in `ROADMAP.md` row `DUR-1`. |

### `flapjack ingest` Beta Bounds

- Inputs: JSON array files, NDJSON files, or `--source -` for stdin. The parser keeps memory bounded by `--batch-size` and reports `queue_high_watermark`.
- Credentials: exactly one of `--api-key-env`, `--api-key-file`, or `--api-key-stdin` is accepted. `--api-key` is intentionally not a CLI option so secrets are not exposed through help text, shell history, or process listings.
- Writes: the CLI sends bounded batch envelopes to the same authenticated batch endpoint used by normal clients. Upsert is default and preserves target-only records. Deletes happen only when a source record carries the configured action field with `delete` or `deleteObject`.
- Retries: one serialized envelope owns one `x-flapjack-idempotency-key` across retry attempts. The beta retries transport failures plus HTTP `429` and `503`, caps `Retry-After`, and reports `retries`, `last_retry_after_ms`, `confirmed_committed`, and `outcome_unknown`.
- Recovery: when the JSON report shows `outcome_unknown > 0`, rerun the same source with the same idempotent object IDs after checking the destination. Do not treat unknown envelopes as confirmed writes.
- Replace mode: `--mode replace` normalizes the source into bounded temporary storage, streams it to the admin-authenticated bulk-replace job API, polls durable status to a terminal disposition, and reports the server-confirmed committed count. It is node-local only; peer-routed and older-server refusals remain typed `replace_not_supported` failures with zero confirmed mutations.
- Bulk replace tuning: staged bulk builds use bulk-only writer and document-checkpoint knobs (`FLAPJACK_BULK_BUILD_WRITER_BUFFER_SIZE`, `FLAPJACK_BULK_BUILD_DOCUMENT_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`) without changing the online write queue defaults. Both are frozen at the behavior-preserving baseline (20,000,000-byte writer buffer, 1,000-document checkpoint) with a recorded local-locality gate measurement; raising the bulk-only budget requires a reference-locality (`i4i.4xlarge` NVMe) sweep that is a paid AWS scale run deferred to the named successor "paid reference ladder" batch.

## Index Settings

| All remaining Algolia settings | ✅ | Full parity per §10 of parity report |

## Analytics & Insights

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Search query logs | ✅ | |
| Analytics API (top queries, no-results, no-clicks) | ✅ | |
| Events / Insights API | ✅ | click, conversion, view events with position tracking |
| Event Debugger | ✅ | Per-index event stream inspection |
| A/B Testing (experiments) | ✅ | Traffic split, variant tracking, winner selection. List filtering uses exact `indexName` matching separately from `indexPrefix`/`indexSuffix`; owner: `engine/flapjack-http/src/handlers/experiments/mod.rs::list_experiments`. |
| Usage metering | ✅ | Per-key, per-index operation counts |
| Analytics retention cleanup | ✅ | Partition-based retention cleanup is configurable with `FLAPJACK_ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS`, defaults to 90 days, skips malformed/non-partition paths, and is covered by deterministic cutoff tests. |
| Durable analytics rollup storage | ✅ | Rollup writer + query planner fallback + certified-coverage retention gate are shipped. Proof: `engine/src/analytics/writer.rs` (rollup writer), `engine/src/analytics/query/mod.rs` (rollup planner with raw fallback), `engine/src/analytics/retention.rs` + `engine/src/analytics/manifest.rs` (certified-coverage delete gate), `engine/loadtest/soak_proof.sh` (soak evidence flow). Rollout design and test-citation details are retained in private stage evidence. |

## Personalization & AI

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Personalization API | ✅ | Event scoring, user profile building, personalizationImpact |
| Personalization in search | ✅ | Profile applied at query time |
| Recommendations API | ✅ | `related-products`, `bought-together`, and `trending` ship unconditionally. `looking-similar` works on every published target, using vector similarity when vector search and an embedder are available and content/term similarity otherwise. The shipped fallback needs no model download or new runtime dependency; it replaced the default-feature empty response on 2026-08-04 while preserving legitimate empty vector answers instead of silently changing strategies. |
| AI Search / RAG endpoint | ✅ | Chat-style query with LLM reranking |
| Re-ranking (enableReRanking) | ✅ | |
| Vector search | ✅ | usearch + fastembed, compile-time feature flag with runtime capability detection via `/health`. Dashboard is capability-aware. See [VECTOR_SEARCH_QUICKSTART.md](3_IMPLEMENTATION/VECTOR_SEARCH_QUICKSTART.md) for setup |

## API Keys & Security

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| API Keys | ✅ | Create, list, update, delete |
| ACL (Access Control Lists) | ✅ | search, browse, addObject, deleteObject, etc. |
| Key restrictions | ✅ | maxHitsPerQuery, queryParameters, indexRestrictions, referers, description, and `restrictSources` are enforced. |
| Rate limiting per key | ✅ | |
| Security Sources / Vault | ✅ | Secrets injection for external sources |
| Secured API keys (signed) | ✅ | Malformed/non-UTF-8-boundary secured keys are rejected as `400`, not a parser panic (2026-07-31). |
| Route authorization default | ✅ | Fail-closed: a path matching no ACL rule is denied rather than allowed through (`RouteAcl::Unmapped`, 2026-07-31). |
| Admin credential transport | ✅ | Admin-ACL routes accept the key only in the `x-algolia-api-key` header; the query-string form is refused so admin keys stay out of logs, shell history, and proxy access logs. Search-scoped keys keep query-string support for browser clients (2026-07-31). |
| Analytics client-IP minimization | ✅ | Persisted analytics coarsen the client IP before write (IPv4 → /24, IPv6 → /48); the full address is never stored (2026-07-31). |
| Container runtime posture | ✅ | The image runs as non-root `flapjack:flapjack` at fixed UID/GID `10001:10001`, and refuses to start with an actionable non-zero exit when `/data` is not writable (2026-07-31). |
| Dashboard dependency supply chain | ✅ | CI gates the bundled dashboard on a high-and-above production `npm audit`, with a deliberately-vulnerable fixture proving the gate can fail (2026-07-31). |
| Server-side TLS | ✅ | Static PEM startup plus ACME-backed hot rotation are shipped. Startup fails closed for unreadable, malformed, incomplete, or mismatched material. A valid renewed generation updates the next TLS handshake without rebinding the listener or restarting the process; malformed publication keeps serving the last valid certificate. Plaintext HTTP-01 challenges remain reachable while other plaintext API requests stay rejected. Receipts: `4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_03_aug03_11am_3_acme_material_lifecycle_receipt.md` and `2026_08_03_aug03_11am_7_tls_hot_reload_receipt.md`. |
| Security audit event coverage | ✅ | Eleven audited actions — `authenticate`, `create_key`, `update_key`, `delete_key`, `restore_key`, `generate_secured_key`, `delete_index`, `set_settings`, `import_snapshot`, `restore_snapshot_from_s3`, `rotate_admin_key` — over two outcomes (`success`, `failure`), each carrying actor / action / target / outcome. Targets are mapped through a bounded route-template vocabulary, so no key material, header value, or query payload reaches an event. Emission is consolidated in one owner, `engine/flapjack-http/src/security_audit.rs` (2026-08-01). Per `SD-006` the engine emits a structured stream and does **not** own durable retention — this does not close fjcloud's audit-trail control. |
| Snapshot server-side encryption (S3) | ✅ | S3 snapshot uploads set server-side encryption rather than relying on bucket defaults: `AES256` when `FLAPJACK_S3_SSE` is unset, or `aws:kms` with an optional `FLAPJACK_S3_SSE_KMS_KEY_ID`; any other value is a startup-time error. The response SSE header is verified rather than assumed. Source: `engine/src/index/s3.rs`; probe: `engine/tests/s3_sse_http_probe.sh` (2026-08-01). |
| Snapshot at-rest encryption (local export) | ⚠️ | `export_to_bytes` / `import_from_bytes` support optional AES-256-GCM-SIV encryption through `FLAPJACK_SNAPSHOT_KEY_FILE`; the pinned four-case producer/consumer symmetry probe passed. `export_to_tarball` / `import_from_tarball` remain plaintext helpers, so the surviving helper scope stays open as `SEC-G5`. |
| S3 failure propagation | ✅ | Upload, delete, **and list** reject non-success HTTP responses, and retention call sites propagate or log those failures. `list_snapshots` checks the ListObjectsV2 status before parsing the body and returns `S3("S3 list: HTTP <status>")` instead of a downstream XML parse error (2026-08-02). All three focused regressions exist — `upload_snapshot_fails_loudly_when_bucket_rejects_the_put`, `delete_snapshot_fails_loudly_when_bucket_rejects_delete`, `list_snapshots_fails_loudly_when_bucket_rejects_list` — and `cargo test -p flapjack --lib -- index::s3::tests` reported `14 passed`. Closes `ROADMAP.md` row `DUR-2`. Source: `engine/src/index/s3.rs`; receipt: [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_3_s3_list_failure_propagation_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_3_s3_list_failure_propagation_receipt.md). |
| Replication peer authentication | ⚠️ | A distinct configured peer credential serves replication and is provably refused on `add_cluster_peer`, `remove_cluster_peer`, and `rotate_admin_key` by `engine/tests/replication_peer_auth_http_probe.sh`; receipt: the reviewed private replication peer auth receipt. **Both `SEC-G9` residuals closed 2026-08-02.** The credential is no longer optional: `startup.rs::validate_replication_peer_credential` refuses to start a node that configures replication peers without `FLAPJACK_REPLICATION_API_KEY`. Cleartext peer transport is refused by default: `flapjack-replication/src/config.rs::NodeConfig::validate_credentialed_peer_transport` rejects an `http://` peer origin that would carry a credential — across static, persisted, bootstrap, and runtime `POST /internal/cluster/peers` paths — unless `FLAPJACK_ALLOW_CLEARTEXT_REPLICATION_PEERS=1` is set explicitly. Background rollup fan-out (`analytics_cluster.rs::push_rollup_to_peers`) now authenticates with the peer credential instead of running unauthenticated. Receipts: [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_4_replication_peer_identity_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_4_replication_peer_identity_receipt.md), [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_03_aug03_5am_0_runtime_peer_transport_regression_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_03_aug03_5am_0_runtime_peer_transport_regression_receipt.md). Operator upgrade path: [`3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md`](3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md) rolling-upgrade runbook. |
| Dashboard session credential storage | ✅ | **Shipped 2026-08-03, closing `ROADMAP.md` row `SEC-G3`.** The console no longer keeps admin credentials where a same-origin script can read them. It exchanges the key once at `POST /1/dashboard/session` for a server-owned `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/` cookie (`Secure` when served over TLS); `DELETE /1/dashboard/session` revokes server-side. `engine/dashboard/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` persists **only** `appId` through its zustand `partialize`, with a `migrate` that drops legacy persisted key material on upgrade, so an authenticated reload survives without the key ever returning to browser storage. The durable store is `engine/flapjack-http/src/auth/session.rs`: it mints, validates, revokes, and survives restart, persisting only a keyed fingerprint plus salted HMAC-SHA256 verifiers in a `0o600` `dashboard_sessions.json`, and the plaintext token and the admin key each appear **zero** times in the persisted bytes (17/17 focused tests green). Header-key auth is unchanged for SDKs, InstantSearch, and HTTP probes — only the browser console switched. **Fail-capability is proven at both tiers, not asserted:** with `HttpOnly` deliberately removed, `auth::tests::session_transport_tests` went `4 passed / 4 failed` and the browser probe failed at `session_auth.spec.ts:44`; restored, engine `8/8` and browser `3/3`. User contract: [`docs/screen_specs/login.md`](../../docs/screen_specs/login.md). Receipts: [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_03_aug03_5am_1_dashboard_session_store_foundation_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_03_aug03_5am_1_dashboard_session_store_foundation_receipt.md), [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_8_dashboard_session_auth_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_8_dashboard_session_auth_receipt.md). The private SD-009 security decision is superseded by this work. |

| Plurals dictionary | ✅ | |
| Compounds dictionary | ✅ | |
| Custom entries | ✅ | |

## Infrastructure

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-tenant isolation | ✅ | Per-tenant memory limits (31 MB buffer, 40 concurrent writers) |
| Oplog replication + startup catch-up | ✅ | Peer oplog replication with pre-serve catch-up (`run_pre_serve_catchup`) |
| S3 snapshots | ✅ | Single-node snapshot APIs ship with scheduled backups and empty-dir auto-restore, verified by the MinIO harness in `engine/examples/s3-snapshot/`. Non-success list-response fidelity closed 2026-08-02 under `ROADMAP.md` row `DUR-2`: upload, delete, and list all reject non-success HTTP responses, so the capability symbol now does claim complete failure propagation. Detail owner: the **S3 failure propagation** row in the Security section above. |
| Published operations APIs | ✅ | Engine-owned consumer contract is published in [`operations_consumer_contract.md`](operations_consumer_contract.md) for `/health`, `/internal/status`, `/internal/cluster/status`, and `/internal/snapshots/capability`. Snapshot capability reports `not_configured` or `configured_unverified`; `configured_unverified` means config exists, not that credentials, bucket existence, or reachability were verified. |
| SSL / TLS | ✅ | In-binary TLS covers operator-supplied PEM startup and ACME-backed material rotation. ACME issuance persists the private key, atomically publishes fullchain/key pairs under the managed material directory, and hot-reloads changed generations in the running rustls listener without a process restart. Plaintext HTTP-01 challenge requests remain reachable on the TLS listener while other plaintext API requests remain rejected. Verified by the Pebble DNS/IP known-answer and served-rotation receipts. |
| OpenAPI spec | ✅ | Auto-generated via utoipa; includes recommend, personalization, and experiments routes with coverage in both `openapi_export_tests` and `openapi::tests`. |
| Memory safety | ✅ | OOM-proof: BufferSizeExceeded → 429, DocumentTooLarge → drop |
| Health endpoint | ✅ | Liveness endpoint (`/health`). |
| Readiness probe (`/health/ready`) | ✅ | Operational readiness probe: returns `{"ready":true}` (200) when no visible tenant directories exist or the first tenant probes successfully; returns canonical 503 when tenant discovery or probing fails. `_`-prefixed and `.`-prefixed directories (e.g. `_usage/`, `analytics/`) are excluded from tenant probing. Source: `engine/flapjack-http/src/handlers/readiness.rs`, `engine/flapjack-http/src/tenant_dirs.rs`. |
| Request latency histograms | ✅ | `request_duration_seconds` Prometheus histogram labeled by bounded `method` + normalized `route` + `status_class`, collected by global middleware and appended to `/metrics`. Source: `engine/flapjack-http/src/latency_middleware.rs`, `engine/flapjack-http/src/handlers/metrics.rs`. |
| Error response parity | ✅ | HTTP status codes match Algolia exactly |

## Operational / Observability

Env-var details for operational behavior are canonical in
[`3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPS_CONFIGURATION.md`](3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPS_CONFIGURATION.md).

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Request ID propagation (Stage 1) | ✅ | Every response includes `x-request-id`, and the same value is attached to the active request span in middleware. Always on (no feature flag/env var). |
| JSON structured logging (Stage 2) | ✅ | Controlled by `FLAPJACK_LOG_FORMAT=json` (`text` default). |
| Configurable CORS origins (Stage 4) | ✅ | `FLAPJACK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` controls restrictive allowlists; empty/unset defaults to loopback-only browser access. |
| Graceful shutdown timeout (Stage 5) | ✅ | `FLAPJACK_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` controls write-queue drain deadline before forced-exit warning. |
| Startup dependency summary (Stage 6) | ✅ | Emits a structured `[startup] Dependency status summary` event in both text and JSON logging modes. |

## SDK & Widget Compatibility

## Source migration — PROVIDER-NEUTRAL CORE + ALGOLIA RESUME SHIPPED

**Status as of 2026-08-06: node-local source discovery and preview ship for Algolia, Meilisearch, and Typesense; authenticated async migration supports all three source adapters, while interrupted-job resume remains Algolia-only. The console reaches all three providers and **all three are browser-proven** as of 2026-08-07 — corrected from an earlier "Algolia only" reading, which the `MIG-21` receipt and the 21-passed targeted three-provider run had already falsified. See the `Dashboard Migrate page` row below and [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) row `MIG-22`, which stays open only because its contract runs in no recurring gate.** Create-only import and `overwrite=true` replacement use the fenced publication owner. Successful async status projects the durable settings/synonym/rule outcome and warnings; non-success states omit that outcome rather than fabricating zeroes. HA-converging import remains refused by design in [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) row `MIG-7`. `MIG-4` is a separate publication-repair proof row, not part of this migration capability.

**Operator CLI:** `flapjack migrate` uses one provider-neutral internal adapter/capture seam and one shared submit/status/cancel/acknowledge lifecycle across the public Algolia, Meilisearch, and Typesense route families. Resume remains Algolia-only. The served provider-parity probe proves local landed-data fidelity through real digest-pinned Meilisearch and Typesense containers: Meilisearch `configured_pk` lands two searchable documents with exact `sku`-to-`objectID` projections, and Typesense categories/products land one category plus two products with exact `id`-to-`objectID` projections. Receipt: `engine/docs2/4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_03_aug03_11am_5_competitor_migration_lands_data_receipt.md`; landed merge: `2c05776c7b9d8f60bae89c34ad819ece084fa2e4`. See the [`flapjack migrate` operator configuration](3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPS_CONFIGURATION.md#flapjack-migrate) for provider connections, secret sources, output, and exit behavior.

| Leg | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|

Synchronous create-only mutation; no console job-status or resume surface. **Not in any release:** `63cd2c54d`, `86b143724` and `5c7e5fc8b` are all non-ancestors of the `v1.0.11` cut `1b32cf727`, so the only installable binary still has an Algolia-only console and no dry-run. | `engine/dashboard/src/pages/{Migrate.tsx,MigrateSections.tsx,migrateHelpers.ts}`; specs `engine/dashboard/tests/e2e-ui/full/migrate-{algolia,meilisearch,typesense}.spec.ts`.

| **Backend ↔ frontend joined end-to-end** | Last clean measurement `59 / 59` at `05c546ca5ba3b8dc92b0cb83e6604f09a7c6c433` on a backend reporting `capabilities.vectorSearch: true` and `vectorSearchLocal: true`: 0 failed, **0 skipped**, 0 not-run, 0 unresolved keys. **P29 (`migrate Algolia index via UI`) is green**, and the prior sweep's vendor-credential attribution is **falsified** — shell→vendor returned HTTP `200` with a real index list, `AlgoliaClient::list_indexes` passed, the server route returned `200`, and the Playwright fixture passed 4 including the invalid-credential UI path. A `403` `Invalid Application-ID or API key` body is byte-identical for an empty key, a bogus key, and a genuine refusal, so it can never on its own attribute a failure to the vendor. **Superseded 2026-08-07 evening — do not read the numerator above as current.** The denominator is now a measured `65` joinable rows over `34` proof keys, and `P30`/`P31` are **no longer red**: the `MIG-22` backend prerequisite that blocked them is repaired and both specs pass. Re-run `node scripts/join_proof_report.mjs` against a full-suite artifact; do not copy `59`, `61`, or `65` forward as a result. | `migrate_from_algolia`; `engine/dashboard/tests/e2e-ui/full/migrate-{algolia,meilisearch,typesense}.spec.ts`; receipts: the reviewed private JOIN-1 predicate receipt and the reviewed private Algolia credential hop findings |

Replica translation detects topology from the source primary, fetches every named replica's own settings, and carries the derived virtual topology plus translated per-replica settings in the create-only migration bundle. Materialization then creates each derived replica as a settings-only virtual sidecar (no physical copy, by design) whose sort order resolves at query time. This contract is live-proven: on 2026-07-19 a real Algolia application with one `virtual(...)` relevance replica and one standard replica migrated end-to-end with a passing machine-verified receipt (jul18_11am batch) covering fixture seeding, import, sort-order proofs on the primary and both replica indexes, sidecar structure, and exact source cleanup. Remaining fidelity limits stay owned by `ROADMAP.md` MIG-11 and surface as documented migration warnings: standard-replica exhaustive sorting is approximated as a virtual replica, and Algolia `relevancyStrictness` semantics differ from Flapjack's deterministic ranking.

Migration warnings expose the remaining replica fidelity limits:

- Algolia standard-replica exhaustive sorting is approximated by blended Flapjack virtual ranking.
- `asc()` and `desc()` tokens in replica `ranking` are lifted ahead of replica `customRanking`; unknown ranking tokens are ignored with warnings.
- Matching-critical fields that diverge from the primary cannot be reproduced independently by a virtual replica.
- Algolia and Flapjack use different `relevancyStrictness` scales, and `nbSortedHits` may differ for deterministic queries.

**Current boundary:** node-local discovery, preview, and authenticated async import support Algolia, Meilisearch, and Typesense; import can create a fresh target or replace an existing target with `overwrite=true`. An interrupted pre-publication Algolia export can be claimed through the explicit admin-authenticated resume route using fresh request-only credentials. Positive status exposes `resumable`, `operation`, and `resumeHandle`; interruption preserves the original absolute `expires_at`. Meilisearch and Typesense resume are not supported. HA import is refused because staged publication is node-local and no convergence epoch exists; that design remains under `MIG-7`.

## Dashboard UI

`dashboard/src/App.tsx` defines 24 derived user-facing route patterns from 24 raw `path=` attributes and two attribute-less index routes, backed by 22 lazy page components. No stub pages remain.
The route inventory spans overview, search/browse, settings, analytics, relevancy controls, security tooling, and migration workflows with no placeholder pages.

**Caveat — route shipped ≠ backend capability joined.** Last clean joined dashboard proof is `59 / 59` at `05c546ca5ba3b8dc92b0cb83e6604f09a7c6c433`, measured by the Playwright JSON reporter, `dashboard/tests/e2e-ui/join_proof_manifest.json`, and `dashboard/scripts/join_proof_report.mjs`; do not re-derive it by hand. **A capability-gated skip is never counted toward the numerator.** **The manifest has since grown and the current denominator is 61, not 59:** 92 backend rows = 65 dashboard-route rows (61 with a proof key, 4 with no candidate spec) + 19 API-only + 7 config-only + 1 CLI-only. The two rows added are the Meilisearch and Typesense console migration flows, and both are red on [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) row `MIG-22`. Console-absent backend modes include async `overwrite=true`, migration status/cancel/acknowledge/resume, bulk-replace cancellation, and auto-heal lifecycle. **Runtime HA peer add/remove left this list on 2026-08-03:** the Cluster screen now drives the internal add/remove endpoints, with served mutations confirmed through `/internal/cluster/status`. Receipts: the reviewed private join1 sweep receipt and the reviewed private cluster peer screen receipt.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### E2E Browser Tests (Playwright)

The current inventory is 57 Playwright spec files, counted 2026-08-06 by `find engine/dashboard/tests -name '*.spec.ts'`: 40 full `e2e-ui` specs, seven top-level `e2e-ui` specs, five smoke specs, four `e2e-api` specs, and one `e2e-binary` spec.

**Harness capability provisioning is now declared, not implicit (2026-08-06).** `engine/dashboard/tests/e2e_backend_contract.json` is the single owner of which backend capabilities the specs require, and `engine/tests/test_dashboard_e2e_backend_contract.py` — run in `ci.yml`'s `release-contracts` job — holds every job that starts a backend and then runs dashboard specs to that contract, asserts its own invocation so unwiring it reds, and resolves each npm script's actual spec selection per Playwright invocation. A contract naming an absent variable now forces a fresh backend instead of silently reusing an incapable one, because `startPlaywrightServers` previously passed `allowReuse: true` and the environment was only ever set inside `spawnBackendServer`.

**The dashboard composition is not currently green.** At `ddb6fccef82af3e43eedf88778a89f28dd2cbe33`, run 2 of `./s/test --dashboard-full` returned 1 with Vitest 663/663, smoke UNPARSEABLE/DID NOT RUN, and full UNPARSEABLE/DID NOT RUN at preflight load 23.08/52.28/59.43; run 3 returned execution-tool exit 1 after exact-PID interruption with Vitest 663/663, smoke 17/0/0/0/0/17, and full 357/1/0/8/1/367 at preflight load 25.37/35.87/50.05. **Two of the audit's three residuals were closed later the same day; only one remains.** Valid Algolia runtime inputs were missing at audit time and were **resolved 2026-07-30 by the credential repoint**. The Playwright HTML reporter not returning was **fixed at `53391b794` (2026-07-30 11:57), after the audit was measured** — Playwright resolves the reporter's `open` as `PLAYWRIGHT_HTML_OPEN || options.open || 'on-failure'`, so a red run on a TTY served the report and blocked forever; `engine/dashboard/playwright.config.ts` now pins `open: 'never'` and `playwright.config.test.ts` pins that setting with a regression test. The remaining open residual is the inconclusive run-2 Vite/webserver startup failure. **The re-proof has not been run**, so the numbers above stand as the last measured result even though two of their causes are gone.

The prior all-green claim at `aa7dd7db61d7e274cdf946ac6dd7d7435c4dcdf4` (2026-03-26, all 14 wrapper sections, exit 0) is retained as superseded historical evidence. It is four months and 77+ lane merges behind current source and must not be read as present-tense status.
Coverage includes smoke and full-browser flows across index creation, search, faceting, settings, analytics, dictionaries, security sources, API keys, and migration.

Coverage hardened by three MAR18 workstreams (merged 2026-03-18):

| Workstream | Scope | Record |
|---|---|---|
| A — CRUD & Data Management | Documents, settings, rules, merchandising, API keys, dictionaries, security sources (7 stages, 19/19 checks) | Internal workstream checklist retained in the dev repo |
| B — Intelligence & Analytics | Analytics, query suggestions, experiments, personalization, recommendations (5 stages, 18/20 checks) | Internal workstream checklist retained in the dev repo |
| C — System, Devtools, Edge Cases | System/metrics/migration reconciliation, devtools, navigation dedup, adversarial search, shared constants (6 stages, 16/16 checks) | Internal workstream checklist retained in the dev repo |

Quality standards: zero ESLint violations, zero CSS class selectors, zero sleeps, zero conditional assertions, content verification (not just visibility), deterministic seed data with cleanup.

### Tour Video Walkthroughs (Playtour) — removed 2026-07-30

The `engine/dashboard/tour/` video-walkthrough system has been deleted. It recorded MP4
walkthroughs of each dashboard feature using an external tool, `playtour`, loaded from a
fixed local path outside this repository. That path no longer exists, so the system had been
unrunnable since it was last touched on 2026-04-14 and could not be revived here.

Its one live dependency, the shared product fixture, moved to
`engine/loadtest/product-seed-data.mjs`, which is where its remaining consumers are.

End-to-end proof of dashboard behaviour now comes solely from the Playwright e2e-ui suite
above, which runs unattended. **Corrected 2026-08-03: it is not green.** The most recent
measured composition (rented `i4i.2xlarge`, `us-east-1`, source SHA `3c2f2343`) was
`347 passed / 1 failed / 20 skipped` for the full UI phase and `62 passed` for `e2e-api`.
The single failure — `readme-screenshots.spec.ts` search readiness — was fixed after that run
and proved with a focused `5 passed`, but no second full-suite pass has been claimed.

**Browser-test standard conformance gate (2026-08-02).** `npm run lint:e2e` in
`engine/dashboard/` enforces `tests/e2e-ui/eslint.config.mjs` at `--max-warnings 0` over every
`e2e-ui` spec and helper. The measured pre-gate corpus was 234 hits across 49 swept files —
115 `playwright/no-raw-locators`, 44 `playwright/no-conditional-in-test`, 27
`playwright/no-useless-not`, 18 `playwright/no-conditional-expect`, seven
`playwright/expect-expect`, six `no-restricted-syntax` — all repaired with role-based or
scoped permitted locators rather than by widening the allow-list. Screen specs are the source
of truth for the target behavior of any screen a lane changes; the template is
[`docs/screen_specs/_template.md`](../../docs/screen_specs/_template.md) and the current route
audit is [`docs/screen_specs/_audit.md`](../../docs/screen_specs/_audit.md). Receipt:
[`4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_5_browser_standard_conformance_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_08_02_aug02_11am_5_browser_standard_conformance_receipt.md).

### Load & Stress Testing (k6)

k6 test suite in `engine/loadtest/` covering concurrent production traffic patterns. See [`engine/loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md`](../loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md).

| Scenario | File | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke | `scenarios/smoke.js` | Health, basic search/write, gate before heavier runs |
| Search throughput | `scenarios/search-throughput.js` | Concurrent read performance, p95/p99 latency under ramp |
| Write throughput | `scenarios/write-throughput.js` | Batch write concurrency, task creation rate, error rates |
| Mixed workload | `scenarios/mixed-workload.js` | Concurrent reads + writes, tagged metrics per workload |
| Spike | `scenarios/spike.js` | Traffic burst recovery, error rates during sudden load jump |
| Memory pressure | `scenarios/memory-pressure.js` | Validates memory_middleware.rs behavior at Normal/Elevated/Critical pressure levels |

### Large-Dataset Benchmarking (100k docs)

Added by mar22_2. Deterministic 100k-doc product dataset generator with import throughput, search latency, and concurrent load benchmarks. See [`engine/loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md`](../loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md) for results.

| Tool | File | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset generator | `generate_dataset.mjs` | Deterministic 100k product docs from 25 base products, batched JSONL output |
| Import benchmark | `import_benchmark.sh` / `import_benchmark.mjs` | Batch ingest throughput, per-batch latency (avg/p95/p99), error rate |
| Search benchmark | `search_benchmark.sh` / `search_benchmark.mjs` | Latency by query type (prefix, typo, multi-word, facet, geo, filter, highlight) |
| k6 concurrent load | `benchmark_k6.sh` | Full k6 suite against 100k-doc index |
| Dashboard perf | `tests/e2e-ui/full/large-index-perf.spec.ts` | Page load and search responsiveness with 100k-doc index |

### Regression Guard Scripts

CI-runnable scripts that verify documentation accuracy and API completeness against a live server.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `engine/tests/readme_api_smoke.sh` | Starts a clean server, executes every API curl example from the root README, asserts correct responses |
| `engine/tests/validate_doc_links.sh` | Checks all internal markdown links in the current public routing docs (`README.md`, `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `engine/README.md`, `engine/docs/HIGHEST_LEVEL.md`, `engine/docs2/FEATURES.md`, and `engine/docs2/1_STRATEGY/HIGHEST_PRIORITY.md`) resolve to real files |
| `engine/tests/integration_smoke.sh` | Comprehensive 513-line API integration test: 13 categories (health, index CRUD, doc CRUD, search variants, settings, synonyms, rules, analytics, API keys, dashboard, multi-index, browse, task status). Added by mar22_pm_3. |
| `engine/tests/upgrade_smoke.sh` | Starts an older binary on a temp data dir, seeds data, then upgrades that same dir to a newer binary and re-verifies health/readiness/search/write/dashboard |

## Current Production-Readiness State

Production-readiness checklist organized by priority tier. Tier 1 items were launch blockers, Tier 2 items are required for production confidence, Tier 3 items can be iterated on post-launch.

v1.0.11, published 2026-08-06, is the current shipped baseline; nobody is running it (see [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](../../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)). Corrected 2026-08-03: this sentence previously overstated the release's commercial adoption. This section remains the canonical readiness snapshot while strategic priority order is routed to [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](../../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) and ongoing lane-state/post-ship sequencing is routed to [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) to avoid duplicate live-status prose in this owner.

**Last updated: 2026-08-06** — baseline moved to the published `v1.0.11`; `REL-11`, `MIG-15`, `MIG-18`, `MIG-20`, `DUR-3`, and `SEC-G5` closed; `JOIN-1` remeasured at `56 / 59` with zero skips. Earlier reconciliation (2026-08-04) against `SEC-G3`, ACME hot rotation, `PR-13`, and runtime HA membership stands.

### Tier 1 — Launch Blockers

These must be complete before any customer-facing deployment or open-source release.

| # | Work Item | Status | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| PR-1 | `./s/test --all` green | ✅ Done (2026-03-26) | Exact-HEAD wrapper verification passed at commit `aa7dd7db61d7e274cdf946ac6dd7d7435c4dcdf4`, with all 14 sections green. A second independent wrapper proof also completed green on 2026-03-26. Both are superseded historical evidence, not present-tense status. |
| PR-2 | Load & stress testing | ✅ Done (2026-03-19) | k6 suite in `engine/loadtest/` — 6 scenarios covering search throughput, write throughput, mixed workload, spike, and memory-pressure validation. Branch: `batman/mar19_2_load_stress_testing`. |
| PR-3 | Tour video completion (Phases 2–5) | ✅ Done (2026-03-20); refreshed 2026-03-30 | Original closure shipped 22/24 archived MP4 artifacts. The former vector/chat blockers (05/06) were later closed with dedicated specs plus default-build/vector+AI runtime wiring, bringing archived per-feature MP4 coverage to 24/24. Branch: `batman/mar19_3_tour_videos_phases_2_5`. |
| PR-4 | UI/UX audit, polish & Tour Phase 6 | ✅ Done (2026-03-21) | Two parts that must happen together: (1) **Tour Phase 6** — watch all 22 recorded tour videos and identify every moment of confusion, awkward flow, or unclear labeling; (2) **Fix + re-record** — address identified issues across the shipped dashboard route set, re-record final polished videos, create index video. Scope includes error message quality (are failure states helpful and actionable?), empty states, loading states, workflow coherence, information hierarchy. Known issues: (a) API Keys layout "feels chaotic", (b) System > Index Health "too much info at once", (c) sidebar index list clutter. The tour videos are the no-manual-QA equivalent of a human QA pass — watching them *is* the human-perspective walkthrough. |
| PR-9 | Security audit | ✅ Done (2026-03-21) | Stage 1 closed targeted evidence gaps: malformed-request rejection without panic plus sanitized invalid-credential bodies (`engine/tests/test_security_audit.rs`), restricted-key cross-index denial using shared `key_allows_index()` (`engine/tests/test_tenant_isolation.rs`, `engine/flapjack-http/src/handlers/search/batch.rs`), and API-key entropy coverage near `generate_hex_key()` (`engine/flapjack-http/src/auth_tests/key_store_tests.rs`, `engine/flapjack-http/src/auth/key_store.rs`). Full OWASP top-10 pass complete (2026-05-25). |
| PR-14 | First-run experience audit | ✅ Done (2026-03-21) | Follow the root quickstart in `../../README.md` from a blank machine with fresh eyes. Time how long it takes to go from binary download → first index → first working search. Document every friction point, confusing error, or missing step. Fix and update docs until the experience is under 5 minutes with zero head-scratching. This is the single highest-impact thing for open-source adoption — a frustrated developer who can't get started in 5 minutes closes the tab. |

### Tier 2 — Production Confidence

Required before we can honestly ask anyone to run this in production. **Flapjack has no users and no customers today** (see [`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](../../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)); this tier is the adoption bar, not an incident-response backlog.

| # | Work Item | Status | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| PR-5 | Accessibility (axe-core + WCAG) | ✅ Done (2026-03-21) | `@axe-core/playwright` integrated into Playwright suite (`accessibility.spec.ts`). Automated WCAG violation detection covers all dashboard routes for missing labels, broken ARIA, and contrast issues. Known Radix-tab ID suppressions documented inline. |
| PR-6 | Deep health check | ✅ Done (2026-03-21) | `/health/ready` ships as an operational readiness probe (`engine/flapjack-http/src/handlers/readiness.rs`) with canonical 503 failure envelope and 200 on healthy/empty-node states. Bug fixed 2026-03-23: `_usage/` excluded from tenant probing in `tenant_dirs.rs`. Future depth additions (S3 accessibility, replication connectivity, index-file readability) tracked separately if needed. |
| PR-7 | Latency histograms + performance baseline | ✅ Done (2026-03-21) | Stage 3 shipped request-latency histogram instrumentation (`engine/flapjack-http/src/latency_middleware.rs`) and `/metrics` exposition integration (`engine/flapjack-http/src/handlers/metrics.rs`). Stage 4 published the benchmark baseline in [`engine/loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md`](../loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md); `engine/loadtest/run.sh` exits with code 99 only for threshold breaches while completing all scenarios. Benchmark figures remain owned by `BENCHMARKS.md`. |
| PR-8 | Error recovery + data durability | ✅ Done (2026-03-21) | Delivered targeted integration tests: (a) crash-during-indexing → restart → zero data loss (`crash_durability_test.rs`), (b) restart-during-active-writes → acknowledged writes survive (`restart_during_writes_test.rs`), (c) replication peer catch-up reconnection, (d) S3 backup/restore round-trip, (e) multi-tenant isolation under adversarial load (`test_tenant_isolation.rs`). 2h soak artifacts prove bounded latency and exact post-restart count preservation. |
| PR-10 | Chaos / resilience testing | 🟡 Partially covered — 1 mode open (2026-08-01) | **Narrowed 2026-08-01:** the originally planned `engine/scripts/chaos_test.sh` + `engine/tests/test_resilience_isolation.rs` were never created and remain the one still-open mode. Of the four named adversarial modes: **kill-server-mid-write is covered** by `crash_durability_test.rs`, `restart_during_writes_test.rs`, and `idempotency_restart_durability_test.rs`. **fill-disk-mid-write now has a bounded Darwin APFS probe and an automated acceptance contract** — `engine/_dev/s/manual-tests/20260730_disk_exhaustion_durability.sh` (bounded 32 MiB attached image, evidence-before-teardown, exact-PID interrupt handling) and `engine/loadtest/tests/disk_exhaustion_acceptance.sh` (sole automated evidence consumer) — but the mode remains **product-gap-routed, not closed**: retained specimens prove no panic and a sanitized HTTP 500 rejection, yet a rejected batch replays into the index on restart (76 acknowledged vs 80 recovered, extras `disk-020-00`..`disk-020-03`, reproduced 5/5), and the post-restart write property is unproven. Closing it requires fixing the write-queue durable-admission / commit-finalization defect in `engine/src/index/write_queue/{admission.rs,finalization.rs,mod.rs}` — tracked as `ROADMAP.md` row `DUR-1` — and then three sequential final-HEAD specimens passing `disk_exhaustion_acceptance.sh`. **partition-replica-from-primary is now covered** by an asserted replica-partition-healing contract: `engine/examples/ha-cluster/test_ha_partition.sh` drives isolate→acknowledged-write→heal→exact-set convergence with acknowledged-union and no-ack oracles. **OOM-kill-and-restart is now covered**: `engine/examples/ha-cluster/test_oom_kill_durability.sh` forces a Docker `State.OOMKilled=true` kill mid-write and asserts acknowledged-write recovery equals the acknowledged oracle with zero rejected-batch replay; `engine/loadtest/scenarios/memory-pressure.js` still only observes memory-pressure middleware and is not the OOM oracle. Both scenarios are held by the standing acceptance contract `engine/loadtest/tests/chaos_residual_modes_acceptance.sh`, whose fail-capability is proven by `engine/loadtest/tests/chaos_residual_modes_acceptance_selftest.sh` driving each scenario's own negative control (`FLAPJACK_OOM_NEGATIVE_EMPTY_RESTART=1`, `FLAPJACK_PARTITION_SKIP_HEAL=1`) red. Evidence receipts: [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_07_30_jul30_12am_5_disk_exhaustion_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_07_30_jul30_12am_5_disk_exhaustion_receipt.md), [`4_EVIDENCE/2026_07_31_jul31_5pm_1_chaos_residual_modes_receipt.md`](4_EVIDENCE/2026_07_31_jul31_5pm_1_chaos_residual_modes_receipt.md). |

### Post-Launch Work

Important for long-term operational maturity. Can iterate after initial release.

| # | Work Item | Status | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| PR-11 | Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) | ✅ Done (2026-03-28) | OTLP gRPC trace export is shipped behind the `otel` Cargo feature flag. Runtime configuration uses `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, and startup wiring now initializes OTEL when the endpoint is set. |
| PR-12 | Runbooks & incident response | ✅ Done (2026-05-25) | Closeout verified in `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md` with 19 `### Scenario` runbooks and explicit `**Test (where applicable):**` markers; Stage 2 regression coverage commands reran green at HEAD in this stage: `cargo test -p flapjack-http readiness::tests -- --test-threads=1`, `cargo test -p flapjack-http startup_catchup::tests -- --test-threads=1`, `cargo nextest run --test test_replication -E "test(test_startup_catchup_noop_without_replication) or test(test_two_node_startup_catchup_via_get_ops) or test(test_restart_catches_up_before_serving)"`, and `cargo nextest run -p flapjack-server --test admin_key_test` (evidence intentionally excludes the separately tracked ignored admin-key concurrency regression). |
| PR-16 | Disaster recovery measured backup/restore contract | ✅ Done (2026-05-25) | File-snapshot DR contract is now documented in [`engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`](3_IMPLEMENTATION/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md) from the Stage 1 measured artifact (`engine/target/dr_proof/latest/measurements.txt`): `RPO_MEASURED_MS=10`, `RTO_MEASURED_MS=221`, and exact `DOC_COUNT_AT_SNAPSHOT=DOC_COUNT_AT_RESTORE=550` parity under active-write snapshot capture. |
| PR-13 | Mobile / responsive dashboard | ✅ Done (2026-08-03) | Shared 390px overflow is closed. The audited denominator is 23 authenticated routes, and all 23 are usable without document-level horizontal overflow. `AUD-SHARED-001` in [`docs/screen_specs/_audit.md`](../../docs/screen_specs/_audit.md) is closed; rendered evidence identified `Layout.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, and `ApiLogger.tsx` as the owners. The route-audit exit reported `tested 23 usable 23`, and its negative control made all 23 routes unusable before restore, proving the oracle can fail. This is 390px usability, not phone-native optimisation; the admin console remains deliberately desktop-first. Receipt: the reviewed private dashboard 390px receipt. |
| PR-14 | Search HA ownership/freshness design | 🔴 Deferred / design gate required | Active health probing already exists, but automatic search write promotion remains unsafe until index ownership, generation/term, replica freshness, restart recovery, and split-brain behavior have one tested source of truth. Safe forwarding/503 behavior can proceed after that abstraction is specified. |
| PR-15 | Durable analytics rollup writer/query planner | ✅ Done (2026-05-25) | The Apr 15 design foundation is now fully closed: rollup writer, query-planner fallback, and certified-coverage retention gating are shipped. See the durable analytics row in [Analytics & Insights](#analytics--insights) for canonical code-owner and proof references. |

### Completed Work Archive

| Date | Milestone | Details |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 2026-05-27 | may27_1: PL-9 rollup window override shipped (commits `9353fca8` + `05b4ae8b`) | `FLAPJACK_ROLLUP_WINDOW_OVERRIDE_MS` now resolves through `engine/src/analytics/mod.rs`, is consumed by `engine/flapjack-http/src/background_tasks.rs` + `engine/src/analytics/writer.rs`, and is passed through `engine/loadtest/soak_proof.sh` so the soak harness and engine use the same window width. Executable proofs: `engine/loadtest/tests/soak_proof_analytics_acceptance.sh` and `engine/loadtest/tests/analytics_soak_window_override_acceptance.sh`. |
| 2026-05-26 | may26_pm_3: PL-1 test-hang CI-side cap closeout | Canonical timeout-policy completion recorded from current HEAD acceptance proof: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` now enforce `timeout-minutes: 10` on the five direct `cargo nextest run` steps, with contract assertions in `engine/tests/ci_test_timeout_cap_acceptance.sh`. |

| 2026-03-19 | PR-1: `./s/test --all` green | Historical milestone; later superseded by exact-HEAD wrapper reruns, including the final 2026-03-26 green proof at commit `a220e66c`. |
| 2026-03-19 | PR-2: Load & stress testing | k6 suite built — 6 scenarios, `engine/loadtest/`. |
| 2026-03-19–20 | PR-3: Tour videos phases 2–5 | 17 new specs (07-24 minus 05/06), 22/24 total with MP4 artifacts. Rust source fixes: index recovery, relevance scoring. IndexTabBar refactor. |
| 2026-03-20 | mar20_2 observability/security (Stages 1–3) | Stage 1 closed targeted PR-9 security-coverage gaps (malformed-request rejection without panic, sanitized invalid-credential bodies, restricted-key cross-index denial via shared `key_allows_index()`, API-key entropy tests). Stage 2 shipped `/health/ready` with canonical readiness error contract. Stage 3 shipped request-latency histogram instrumentation and `/metrics` exposition wiring. |
| 2026-03-21 | mar20_2 observability/security (Stage 4 baseline artifact) | Published the loadtest baseline artifact in [`engine/loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md`](../loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md); `engine/loadtest/run.sh` now reports threshold-breach runs with exit code 99 after completing all scenarios. |
| 2026-03-21 | mar21_1: Vector search first-class (Stages 1–3) | Stage 1: `capabilities` object (`vectorSearch`, `vectorSearchLocal`) in `/health` + startup banner. Stage 2: all 4 dashboard components capability-aware (Chat, SearchModeSection, EmbedderPanel, VectorStatusBadge) with e2e route-interception tests. Stage 3: `VECTOR_SEARCH_QUICKSTART.md` created and linked. Branch: `batman/mar21_1_vector_search_first_class`. |
| 2026-03-21 | mar21_2: Federated multi-index search (Stages 1–5) | Full Meilisearch-compatible federation: `federation.rs` module (419 lines) with weighted RRF merge, `FederationConfig`/`FederationMeta`/`FederatedResponse` types, wired into batch handler. OpenAPI annotations, JS SDK federation types added. Design doc: `FEDERATED_SEARCH_DESIGN.md`. Integration tests in `test_federated_search.rs`. Branch: `batman/mar21_2_federated_multi_index_search`. |
| 2026-03-21 | mar21_3: Observability & ops hardening (Stages 1–2, 4–6) | Stage 1: `x-request-id` middleware (forwarded or UUID v4 generated). Stage 2: `FLAPJACK_LOG_FORMAT=json` structured logging. Stage 4: `FLAPJACK_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` configurable CORS. Stage 5: `FLAPJACK_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` graceful shutdown. Stage 6: startup dependency summary. Stage 7: `OPS_CONFIGURATION.md` env var reference. Stage 3 (OpenTelemetry OTLP export) was completed later on 2026-03-28. Branch: `batman/mar21_3_observability_ops_hardening`. |
| 2026-03-22 | mar22_1: Regression fix & validation sweep | OpenAPI spec regenerated (federation + observability routes). README API smoke script (`engine/tests/readme_api_smoke.sh`) and doc link validator (`engine/tests/validate_doc_links.sh`) created. Rust test suite and Playwright smoke confirmed green post-merge. Branch: `batman/mar22_1_regression_fix_and_validation_sweep`. |
| 2026-03-22 | mar22_2: Large-dataset performance benchmarking | Deterministic 100k-doc generator (`generate_dataset.mjs`), import throughput benchmark (`import_benchmark.sh`), search latency benchmark by query type (`search_benchmark.sh`), k6 concurrent load runner (`benchmark_k6.sh`), dashboard large-index perf test (`large-index-perf.spec.ts`). Baseline compilation script (`compile_baseline.sh`). Branch: `batman/mar22_2_large_dataset_performance_benchmarking`. |
| 2026-03-22 | mar22_3: HA & deployment verification | Docker single-node, 3-node HA cluster, 2-node replication/analytics fan-out, and S3 snapshot/restore all verified end-to-end via Docker. Dockerfile bind-address fix (`ENV FLAPJACK_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0:7700`). New S3 snapshot example (`engine/examples/s3-snapshot/`). HA test script tightened with in-network health probes. Deployment and HA docs reconciled to match verified proofs. S3 snapshot audit doc (`3_IMPLEMENTATION/S3_SNAPSHOT_AUDIT.md`). Branch: `batman/mar22_3_ha_and_deployment_verification`. |
| 2026-03-23 | mar22_pm_1: Full test suite regression gate | Crate-by-crate Rust test validation, fixed taskID alias collisions in index manager (`lifecycle.rs`, `write.rs`, `mod.rs`), fixed 21 dashboard test regressions (unit + e2e), refreshed openapi snapshot fixture, stabilized query-suggestions e2e, and captured wrapper proof artifacts. That run stayed non-green (`a6a12ea1`); launch authority was later superseded by the green proof at commit `a220e66c`. Branch: `batman/mar22_pm_1_full_test_suite_regression_gate`. |
| 2026-03-23 | mar22_pm_2: Documentation accuracy audit | All 6 stages complete. Mechanical code-vs-docs verification across all public-facing documents: env var completeness (OPS_CONFIGURATION.md canonical), feature comparison table verified, quickstart guides reconciled against live contracts, cross-doc DRY violations fixed, PHASES.md deprecated, terminology normalized. Tightened SSL config assertions (`flapjack-ssl/src/config.rs`). 1 code blocker was logged in an internal audit note (`/health/ready` unit test vs runtime mismatch). All validation scripts pass. Branch: `batman/mar22_pm_2_docs_accuracy_audit`. |
| 2026-03-23 | mar22_pm_3: Benchmark validation & integration smoke | New comprehensive API integration smoke test (`engine/tests/integration_smoke.sh`, 513 lines) exercising 13 API path categories. Updated benchmark baseline compilation (`compile_baseline.mjs/sh`). Large-dataset baseline: 100k docs imported in 48.4s, search p95 128ms, all 6 k6 scenarios PASS (Apple M4 Max). Results in [`engine/loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md`](../loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md). Branch: `batman/mar22_pm_3_benchmark_and_smoke`. |
| 2026-03-24 | mar23_pm_4: README screenshot automation | Created automated Playwright e2e test `readme-screenshots.spec.ts` (73 lines) covering Overview, Search, and Migrate screenshot capture with readiness contracts. Branch: `batman/mar23_pm_4_readme_screenshots`. |
| 2026-03-24 | mar23_pm_5: Systemd VPS deployment docs | Improved `engine/examples/systemd/README.md` with production guidance (env file setup, admin key requirements, `/health/ready` probe verification). This remained docs-only at the time and was later closed by the 2026-03-26 live VPS verification. Branch: `batman/mar23_pm_5_systemd_vps_smoke_test`. |
| 2026-03-24 | mar23_pm_6: Test stability & launch status reconciliation | Fixed `Recommendations.test.tsx` (network-noise isolation, test helper refactoring), `analytics-deep.spec.ts` (California hardcode → flexible assertion), `sdk_test/package.json` update, bundler dedup verification script. Launch docs reconciled with canonical wrapper proof status. Branch: `batman/mar23_pm_6_test_all_green`. |
| 2026-03-25 | mar24_pm_1: test hardening at current HEAD | Hardened `query-suggestions.spec.ts` readiness waits, `local-instance-config.ts` parsing/URL handling, Playwright worker override support, socket-churn retries in Rust integration tests, and refreshed the tracked README screenshot PNGs. Targeted validations passed at HEAD; the port-contention issue seen in earlier wrapper runs was resolved in the final green proof at commit `a220e66c`. Branch: `batman/mar24_pm_1_test_suite_green`. |
| 2026-03-25 | stage_04: exact-HEAD wrapper proof refresh | Ran the canonical wrapper at commit `23ac8a9e76c90cf2c36c447b812acdcbf0e32d4e`; executed sections `[1]-[5]` passed, and the first failing executed section was `[6]` Dashboard Playwright smoke (`127.0.0.1:53142` already in use). |
| 2026-03-25 | mar24_pm_2: repo hygiene fixes | Landed the safe hygiene subset: public-repo URL updates in README/show-HN/deployment docs, `<repo-root>` placeholders in retained docs, path-agnostic deploy/sync helper scripts, and cleanup of the duplicated `load_local_instance_config` TODO block. Destructive doc/history removals from the worktree branch were intentionally not merged into `main`. Branch: `batman/mar24_pm_2_repo_hygiene_sweep`. |
| 2026-03-25 | mar25_pm_10: exact-HEAD wrapper proof | Fixed `local-instance-config.ts` quoted-value comment-stripping bug via TDD (new test file `local-instance-config.test.ts`). Produced proof artifacts in the dev repo. Green run at commit `0dc55b39` passed all executed sections [1]-[13]. Subsequent verification run at commit `23ac8a9e` was red due to Playwright port contention (`127.0.0.1:53142` already in use), not a code defect. Updated launch-status docs. Branch: `batman/mar25_pm_10_exact_head_wrapper_proof`. |
| 2026-03-25 | mar25_pm_11: live linux systemd VPS validation | Attempted VPS validation of systemd deployment path. Fixed the EC2 SSH helper to fall back to `~/.ssh`. Refactored the internal local-instance shell helper to use safe KEY=value parsing instead of shell sourcing — adds helper functions for config loading, hostname extraction, loopback detection, and inline comment stripping. Locally verified systemd artifact consistency (`flapjack.service`/`env.example`/README alignment, `/health` + `/health/ready` route contracts). VPS host reachability timed out at that time; this failed attempt was later superseded by the 2026-03-26 successful live verification. Branch: `batman/mar25_pm_11_live_linux_systemd_vps_validation`. |
| 2026-03-25 | mar25_pm_13: live VPS systemd validation (second attempt) | Re-attempted VPS validation; SSH still timing out to `44.202.224.48`. Code review posthoc stages cleaned up analytics test doc comments (`analytics_tests.rs`: replaced TODO stubs with meaningful descriptions), refactored `hybrid.rs` (removed `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions, simplified `build_fused_document` and `requested_hybrid_params` with idiomatic Rust), and refactored `search_compat.rs` (extracted `search_with_legacy_options` helper, cleaned doc comments). This failed attempt was later superseded by the 2026-03-26 successful live verification. Branch: `batman/mar25_pm_13_live_vps_systemd_validation`. |
| 2026-03-25 | mar25_pm_14: Rust code quality audit + leaky test fix | Fixed the intermittent nextest leak in integration test local helpers (`engine/tests/common/state.rs` and `engine/tests/common/http.rs`): proper server shutdown and resource cleanup to eliminate leaked child processes/file descriptors. Fixed 2 clippy warnings (feature-gated `dead_code` in `hybrid.rs` — resolved by pm_13's posthoc refactor removing the suppressions entirely). Fixed 6 `cargo fmt` diffs (leading blank lines in `dictionaries.rs`, `metrics.rs`, `notifications.rs`, `rollup_broadcaster.rs`, `router_tests.rs`, `startup_catchup.rs`). Additional cleanup in `language.rs`, `decompound.rs`, `stopwords/mod.rs`, `write_queue/` modules. Nextest now reports 0 leaky, 0 failed. `cargo clippy --workspace` clean. `cargo fmt --check` clean. Branch: `batman/mar25_pm_14_rust_quality_leaky_test`. |
| 2026-03-28 | mar28: Stage 4-6 confidence-completeness ops/security pass | Added `engine/tests/upgrade_smoke.sh` and proved upgrade handoff from the gate-closing staging commit `745a059` to the current binary on the same data dir. Added canonical operator docs in [`engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md`](3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md) and scoped hardening guidance in [`engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/SECURITY_BASELINE.md`](3_IMPLEMENTATION/SECURITY_BASELINE.md). Also tightened the MinIO snapshot harness to match its no-auth compose stack and fail fast when a stray local `flapjack` owns `127.0.0.1:7700`. |
| 2026-03-28 | mar28: Stage 3 soak/failure proof pack | Added `engine/flapjack-server/tests/restart_during_writes_test.rs`, extended `crash_durability_test.rs` with a nontrivial acknowledged-dataset recovery proof, and completed 2h `mixed-soak` / `write-soak` artifact capture with `engine/loadtest/soak_proof.sh`. The new soak artifacts prove bounded latency, zero `5xx`, restart-safe recovery, and exact post-soak/post-restart count preservation, while also documenting that the current single-node write-overload thresholds still breach under prolonged overload on this host. |
| 2026-03-26 | mar25_pm_12: Playwright port hardening + wrapper green proof | Fixed port contention between Playwright smoke and full e2e runs within `./s/test --all`. Added a port-release wait step in the canonical test wrapper and `--wait-port-free` mode in `engine/dashboard/scripts/playwright-webserver.mjs`. New vitest coverage for port-wait logic. JSDoc cleanup in `local-instance-config.ts`. Produced an authoritative green exact-HEAD wrapper proof at commit `a220e66c`, with all 14 sections passed. Resolves launch blocker #1 (PR-1). Branch: `batman/mar25_pm_12_playwright_port_wrapper_proof`. |
| 2026-03-26 | stage_04: VPS systemd proof reconciliation | Published a redacted maintained evidence summary in the dev repo from the live Stage 3 run/review, updated launch status ledgers to remove stale VPS blocker language, and added the explicit Linux binary prerequisite in `engine/examples/systemd/README.md`. |
| 2026-03-26 | mar26_am_1: HA cluster dashboard | New Cluster page in React dashboard (`engine/dashboard/src/pages/Cluster.tsx`) showing live peer health with status badges (healthy/stale/unhealthy/circuit_open/never_contacted), auto-refreshing every 5s via `useClusterStatus` hook. Standalone mode shows configuration guidance. Added to sidebar nav and router. Full TDD coverage (`Cluster.test.tsx`, `useClusterStatus.test.ts`). Operator spec at `engine/dashboard/tests/specs/cluster.md`. Branch: `batman/mar26_am_1_ha_cluster_dashboard`. |
| 2026-03-26 | mar26_am_2: VPS systemd end-to-end proof | Full end-to-end systemd deployment validated on Ubuntu EC2 (c7i-flex.2xlarge, us-east-1). Service account, unit file, env file, health probes, restart recovery, crash recovery all confirmed. EC2 helper script secret-path handling was corrected to use the repo-local secret directory. Resolves launch blocker #2. Branch: `batman/mar26_am_2_vps_systemd_proof`. |
| 2026-03-26 | mar26_pm_1: Post-merge regression validation | Full test suite validated green after merging am_1 (HA dashboard) and am_2 (VPS systemd). Cargo check/clippy/fmt clean, 2839+ Rust lib tests, 25 server tests, 542+ vitest, nextest 0 leaky, Playwright smoke+full, SDK/CLI all passing. Metrics handler refactored (extracted `storage_bytes_gauge_values` helper), search_compat doc comments cleaned, common.sh refactored. Green wrapper proof at `aa7dd7db` (superseded historical evidence; not current suite status). Branch: `batman/mar26_pm_1_post_merge_regression_validation`. |
| 2026-03-26 | mar26_pm_2: Debbie config hardening | Replaced dangerous blacklist `.debbie.toml` (syncing entire repo root with 14 exclusions) with proper whitelist config using explicit `sync.files` + targeted `[[sync.dirs]]`. Would have leaked 60+ internal files to public repos. Created `.debbie/post-sync.sh` hook for Cargo.toml path dep fixup. Dry-run validated against staging repo. Branch: `batman/mar26_pm_2_debbie_config_hardening`. |
| 2026-03-26 | mar26_pm_3: README & Show HN launch polish | Fixed 4 stale Show HN claims ("English-only, no vector search, no HA" — all shipped). Root README: feature table verified, architecture tree duplicate fixed, Docker Compose quickstart added (`engine/examples/quickstart/`). engine/README cleaned for public audience. FEATURES.md spec counts corrected to 46. Branch: `batman/mar26_pm_3_readme_launch_polish`. |
| 2026-03-27 | mar26_pm_4: Dev repo test suite + Docker build | Second independent full test suite proof at HEAD; all 14 sections green. Docker build verified with container health + search smoke test. Added `search_compat` shim unit + integration tests. Branch: `batman/mar26_pm_4_dev_repo_test_suite_and_docker`. |
| 2026-03-27 | mar26_pm_5: Debbie staging sync config hardening | Fixed legacy identity values to the correct public-target mappings. Added `ROADMAP.md`, `engine/docs2/` strategy docs, `engine/examples/`, `integrations/laravel-scout/`, CI shell scripts to sync whitelist. Sanitized `FEATURES.md` and `TESTING.md` to remove private dashboard path references for public staging. Executed real debbie sync to staging clone. Stage 4 (staging push + CI) deferred. Branch: `batman/mar26_pm_5_debbie_sync_staging_ci`. |
| 2026-03-27 | mar27_noon: Staging push + CI fix | Fixed `.debbie.toml` whitelist gaps (`validate_doc_links.sh`), fixed post-sync hook to handle `branch =` tantivy deps alongside `path =`, fixed `integration_smoke.sh` executable bit. Pushed to staging repo and drove CI through 6+ rounds of fixes. Key code fixes: dashboard chat e2e specs (embedder readiness), API key create `200` alignment, A/B test create `200` alignment, stale CRUD setup expectations, crash-durability task-poll helper retry robustness, OpenAPI typed-schema corrections. Commits: `d7beff86` through `45374320`. |
| 2026-03-27 | mar27_pm: Launch gate closure + truth-sync | 5-stage launch completion: (1) Staging CI green via gate-closing run `23671792399` on commit `745a059`; (2) truth-synced PRIORITIES.md, ROADMAP.md, HIGHEST_PRIORITY.md to match live launch state; (3) public launch surface audit — README smoke 6/6, doc-link validation green, all live public URLs returning 200; (4) a launch proof pack was created in the dev repo; (5) Algolia compat sprint checklist drafted. |
| 2026-03-27 | mar27_night: Algolia compat hardening | Built deterministic parity foundation: canonical high-risk mutation inventory in `engine/flapjack-http/src/mutation_parity.rs`, behavior-level parity checks in `engine/tests/test_mutation_parity.rs`, spec-level parity checks in `flapjack-http::openapi::tests::high_risk_mutation_openapi_contracts_match_shared_matrix`. Caught and fixed additional drift: `POST /1/indexes/{indexName}` corrected to `201`, missing OpenAPI paths for auto-ID save and partial update, stronger `/2/abtests/{id}/conclude` schema. All 5 stages (mutation matrix, artifact coupling, mirror guards, dashboard readiness contracts, SDK/HTTP reinforcement) complete. |
| 2026-03-28 | mar28: Soak threshold correction + test coverage expansion | Verified staging CI run `23674270883` (33/33 green). Resolved Stage 3 soak threshold breach by introducing `SOAK_WRITE_THRESHOLDS` in `engine/loadtest/lib/throughput.js` — correctly distinguishes sustained-overload acceptance from short-baseline failure. Expanded test coverage: 4 new federation unit tests + 3 handler tests in `batch_federation.rs`, 2 new cluster status backend tests in `internal_tests.rs`, 8 new extended parity lifecycle/error tests in `tests/test_mutation_parity_extended.rs`. All tests green, clippy clean, fmt clean. |
| 2026-03-28 | mar28_pm_1: Security, versioning, and release polish | Created SECURITY.md (vulnerability disclosure policy), CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format with full feature inventory), CONTRIBUTING.md (contributor guide). All three added to `.debbie.toml` sync whitelist. Bumped all 5 workspace crates from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0. Added version consistency test (`engine/flapjack-server/tests/version_consistency_test.rs`). Created a shared version helper for dev release scripts. Branch: `batman/mar28_pm_1_security_versioning_release_polish`. |
| 2026-03-28 | mar28_pm_2: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing (PR-11) | Feature-gated OTEL OTLP gRPC export behind `--features otel` in `flapjack-http`. New `engine/flapjack-http/src/otel.rs` module with `try_init_otel_layer()` — reads `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, builds OTLP exporter when set, returns None when unset (zero overhead). Wired into tracing subscriber composition in `startup.rs` and graceful shutdown in `server.rs` (provider flush). Updated OPS_CONFIGURATION.md, FEATURES.md, ROADMAP.md, PRIORITIES.md. Both `cargo check -p flapjack-http` and `cargo check -p flapjack-http --features otel` pass clean. Branch: `batman/mar28_pm_2_opentelemetry_distributed_tracing`. |
| 2026-03-29 | mar28_pm_3: TODO stub cleanup + HA soak hardening | Replaced ~601 auto-generated `TODO: Document` stubs with real doc comments across all 4 crates (engine/src: 271, flapjack-http: 322, flapjack-server: 3, flapjack-replication: 5). Added a dev-repo HA soak test harness for 3-node restart-rotation validation. Doc-regression tests for `run_graceful_shutdown` and `load_server_config`. Module-level `//!` summaries added to key files. Branch: `batman/mar28_pm_3_code_hygiene_todo_cleanup_ha_soak`. |
| 2026-03-29 | mar29: Codebase cleanup round 2 | Fixed 15 error-leaking 500 response sites in `settings.rs` (7), `snapshot.rs` (7), `query_suggestions.rs` (1) — all migrated to `HandlerError` which auto-sanitizes internal errors. Consolidated duplicate `internal_error` helpers in `rules.rs`/`synonyms.rs` via same migration. Removed 3 `cognitive_complexity` suppressions in `startup_catchup.rs` by extracting `execute_timed_catchup()` and `handle_fetch_error()` helpers. Removed `server.rs` serve() suppression. Decomposed `execute_search_query` (CC=26, 348 NLOC) into phase helpers. Added `validate_restore_key_override` to snapshot handler. New integration test for query suggestions. Updated `engine/CLAUDE.md` with HandlerError and suppression guidance. Branch: `batman/mar29_codebase_cleanup_checklist`. |
| 2026-03-29 | mar29_pm_1: HA multi-node soak harness + CI integration | Completed HA soak confidence infrastructure for the multi-node branch: a dev-repo harness script, Rust structural integration test (`engine/tests/test_ha_soak_harness.rs`), and shell acceptance checks for soak/topology (`engine/loadtest/tests/ha_soak_acceptance.sh`, `engine/loadtest/tests/ha_topology_acceptance.sh`). Multi-node soak execution itself remains Docker-daemon dependent and was explicitly deferred when Docker is unavailable. Branch: `batman/mar29_pm_1_ha_multi_node_soak`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar30_pm_5: Full regression gate + targeted fixes | Ran the full post-merge regression gate across Rust, dashboard, browser, SDK, and Go surfaces. The confirmed regression was FastEmbed test nondeterminism from concurrent ONNX/model cache initialization; affected local-embedder tests are now serialized in `engine/src/vector/embedder_tests.rs` and `engine/src/index/write_queue_tests.rs`. Proof artifacts were recorded in `engine/state/`. The follow-through merge on 2026-03-31 also restored real summaries for `browse_index` and the experiment CRUD/conclude handlers and regenerated `engine/docs2/openapi.json`, leaving `openapi_export_tests::committed_docs2_openapi_matches_export_output` green at current `main`. Branch: `batman/mar30_pm_5_full_regression_gate_targeted_fixes`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar30_pm_6: Public doc sync surface hardening | Hardened the public documentation contract so canonical routing docs are explicitly synced instead of relying on stale mirror state. `.debbie.toml` now whitelists the canonical public doc graph (`ROADMAP.md`, `PRIORITIES.md`, `engine/LIB.md`, `engine/docs2/FEATURES.md`, `engine/loadtest/BENCHMARKS.md`, `engine/docs2/1_STRATEGY/`, `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/`). Added `engine/tests/doc_sync_helpers.sh`, a dedicated `engine/tests/validate_sync_surface.sh`, widened `engine/tests/validate_doc_links.sh`, and scrubbed non-public path references from the newly public docs, including removing dev-only `_dev/s/` multi-instance helpers from `engine/README.md`. Branch: `batman/mar30_pm_6_public_doc_sync_surface_hardening`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_am_2: HA convergence contract + runbook truth sync | Added `engine/docs2/4_EVIDENCE/HA_CONVERGENCE_ANALYSIS.md`, aligned `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md` and `engine/examples/ha-cluster/README.md` with the proven async-replication boundary, and tightened `engine/loadtest/tests/ha_soak_acceptance.sh`. Branch: `batman/mar31_am_2_ha_convergence_contract_and_runbook_truth_sync`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_am_1: Debbie sync wave 3 | Published the then-current post-launch hardening to staging commit `6166055` (CI run `23818440499`) and prod commit `b7841a0` (CI run `23819698304`), carrying the HA boundary truth surfaces, public doc sync contract, regression-gate follow-through, and refreshed committed OpenAPI export. Branch: `batman/mar31_am_1_green_baseline_and_wave3_public_sync`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_pm_1: Nightly CI + sync hygiene | Restored nightly Rust CI parity by stubbing the dashboard dist asset, added `CHANGELOG.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `SECURITY.md` to `.debbie.toml`, and tightened root README vector/hybrid caveats so pre-built Linux/Windows binary limits match the real release matrix. This was later published in the completed public lineage (see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical)). Branch: `batman/mar31_pm_1_ci_and_sync_hygiene`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_pm_2: Operations runbook hardening | Expanded `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md` with proof-backed failure-mode runbooks, ownership cross-links, corrected `reset-admin-key` CLI ordering, and tighter readiness/replication proof citations. This was later published in the completed public lineage (see [Public Sync Lineage Ledger (Canonical)](#public-sync-lineage-ledger-canonical)). Branch: `batman/mar31_pm_2_operations_runbook_hardening`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_pm_3: Security baseline docs + test coverage | Added the canonical HTTP-hardening ledger in `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` and the paired audit matrix in `engine/docs2/4_EVIDENCE/SECURITY_BASELINE_AUDIT.md`, documenting CORS, trusted-proxy, rate-limit, and body-limit behavior with proof references. Added focused security proofs and aligned `startup_catchup.rs` so non-strict bootstrap logs write-queue timeout instead of failing startup. Branch: `batman/mar31_pm_3_security_baseline_docs_and_tests`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_pm_4: Security baseline follow-through | Closed the remaining scoped HTTP-hardening proof gaps with invalid-key non-consumption and `FLAPJACK_MAX_BODY_MB` `413` tests, extracted `max_body_mb_from_value`, aligned the audit/doc surfaces, refreshed `engine/docs2/openapi.json`, and hardened sync helpers against symlinked destinations. Branch: `batman/mar31_pm_4_security_baseline_followthrough`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_pm_5: Runbook parity + admin-key truth sync | Standardized the explicit `flapjack --data-dir <path> reset-admin-key` contract across startup output, dashboard auth help, `engine/docs/AUTH_DESIGN.md`, and `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md`, including shell-quoted output for spaced paths. Branch: `batman/mar31_pm_5_runbook_parity_and_admin_key_truth_sync`. |
| 2026-03-31 | mar31_pm_6: Experiment handler merge guardrails | Routed `/2/abtests/{id}/results` through `resolve_store_and_experiment_id()`, added direct results-endpoint seam proofs for store-unavailable plus numeric/UUID resolution, removed the orphaned old OpenAPI test file, and aligned experiment OpenAPI docs with the resolver-driven `500` path. Branch: `batman/mar31_pm_6_experiment_handler_merge_guardrails`. |
| 2026-04-08 | apr08: targeted cleanup follow-through | Extracted dashboard experiment payload normalization/results typing into `engine/dashboard/src/lib/experiment-normalization.ts` with focused tests, reducing `useExperiments.ts` to hook concerns, and removed a stale `clippy::cognitive_complexity` suppression from `flapjack-http/src/server.rs` after re-verifying the crate stays clippy-clean. Commits: `44e7fa9c`, `7250f00b`. |
| 2026-04-15 | apr07_pm_2: analytics retention hardening | Hardened partition-retention behavior with deterministic cutoff tests, preserved the 90-day default, documented the actual env/config surface, added durable rollup design and known-answer query contracts, and merged rollup schema/config/manifest foundation. Later rollup writer/query-planner/retention-gate shipped status is owned by the Analytics & Insights durable rollup storage row. Branch: `batman/apr07_pm_2_analytics_phase5_retention`. |
| 2026-04-15 | apr07_pm_3: test hygiene and safety audit | Added public CI SDK contract coverage, tightened dashboard/browser false-positive patterns, added targeted plural/analytics collector tests, converted confirmed filter query crash paths to typed errors with safer formatting, sanitized experiment internal errors, removed stale test shims, and aligned canonical runner docs. OpenAPI snapshot follow-up remained deferred in the session handoff. Branch: `batman/apr07_pm_3_test_hygiene_and_safety_audit`. |
