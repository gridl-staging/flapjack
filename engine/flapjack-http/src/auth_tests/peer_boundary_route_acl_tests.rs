//! Stage 1 RED contract for the replication peer-vs-admin boundary.
//!
//! This module locks the *closed* `/internal/*` denominator mounted by
//! `router.rs::build_internal_routes` and pins each route to a peer-allowed or
//! admin-only decision. `route_acl.rs` stays the single owner of route→tier
//! mapping; this table is its exhaustive contract, not a second mapper.
//!
//! The peer-allowed rows assert the tier Stage 2 introduced. The admin-only rows
//! and the unmatched fall-through are GREEN and must stay that way — a
//! permissive fall-through is how a future administrative route silently becomes
//! peer-reachable.
