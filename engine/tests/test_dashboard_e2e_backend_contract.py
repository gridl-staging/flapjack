"""Fail the build when a workflow runs dashboard e2e specs against a backend that cannot satisfy them.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Nightly run 31072375322 (2026-08-06) and prod push CI run 31096601354 (same day)
each failed on a *different* dashboard spec, for the *same* structural reason: the
CI job that starts the Flapjack backend and the spec that declares a backend
precondition had no shared owner, so they drifted.

  - `nightly.yml` "Dashboard all tests" starts a standalone backend and runs
    `npm run test:pages`, which is `playwright test --project=e2e-ui` with no path
    filter — so it includes `tests/e2e-ui/full/cluster_peers.spec.ts`, which throws
    unless replication is configured.
  - `ci.yml` "Dashboard full e2e tests" starts a replication-enabled backend but omits
    `FLAPJACK_AI_ALLOW_LOCAL_URLS`, so `tests/e2e-ui/full/vector-settings.spec.ts`
    trips the outbound SSRF control three times.

Both specs were correct. Both passed the lane that authored them, because that lane
started a backend that satisfied them. Nothing failed until the spec reached a job
whose backend was configured by a different hand.

WHY THE ENV MUST BE ON THE STARTUP STEP
---------------------------------------
`scripts/playwright-webserver.mjs::startPlaywrightServers` passes `allowReuse: true`
for the backend, so a backend already listening on the target port is REUSED and
`spawnBackendServer` — the one place that sets the right environment — never runs.
Environment declared on the Playwright step therefore never reaches the process under
test. This gate deliberately requires the env on the step that launches the binary,
because that is the only step that can supply it.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
1. Every workflow job that starts a Flapjack backend and later runs a dashboard
   Playwright script declares every environment variable required by the specs that
   script actually selects. The selection is resolved from `package.json`, not
   restated here, so a script that gains a path filter cannot escape the contract.
1b. Requirements marked `"base": true` are additionally required of EVERY such job
   regardless of its spec selection, because `assertBackendReadiness` enforces them
   itself and refuses the backend at webServer startup before any spec runs. Checking
   those against the spec selection was a hole in this gate, not a design: on
   2026-08-07 `ci.yml`'s `dashboard-pages` and `dashboard-integration` jobs carried
   neither base requirement, this gate exited 0, and staging run 31213083385 failed
   both jobs with `refused the dashboard local-URL embedder probe`. A static contract
   that exists to guarantee a runtime assertion must be at least as strict as it.
2. `spawnBackendServer` supplies the union of every requirement, because it starts one
   backend for whatever a developer runs locally and must satisfy the widest scope.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
-----------------------------------
It does not run the specs, and it does not verify the running backend reports the
capability. A value can be present and wrong. This is a wiring contract: it catches
the omission that has now happened twice, cheaply, without a browser. The runtime half
is `assertBackendReadiness` in `engine/dashboard/scripts/playwright-webserver.mjs`,
which refuses at startup rather than at spec time.

It also finds a job's backend only by `BACKEND_LAUNCH_RE`, i.e. a `flapjack --data-dir`
invocation. A job that starts one some other way — a container, a wrapper script, a
different flag order — is skipped rather than reported, because "no backend launch
found" is also the correct reading of a job that lets Playwright spawn its own. If a
future job starts its backend differently, extend that pattern; do not assume silence
here means the job was checked.

NON-VACUITY
-----------
Named live specimens at `dcdb8a77a`: this gate reports two findings and exits 1 —
`nightly.yml` job `dashboard` missing `replication` and `ai_local_outbound`, and
`ci.yml` job `dashboard-full-e2e` missing `ai_local_outbound`. Deleting
`FLAPJACK_AI_ALLOW_LOCAL_URLS` from either fixed job, or from `spawnBackendServer`,
returns it to red today.

def check_no_duplicate_step_names() -> list[str]:
    """A job may not declare the same step name twice.

    WHY THIS LIVES IN THIS FILE. This gate already asserts that CI *invokes* it
    (`check_gate_is_wired`). Being invoked is not the same as being reached: GitHub stops
    a job at its first failing step, so any earlier step that fails takes every later step
    with it — including this gate's own. A duplicated step is therefore not a cosmetic
    defect for this gate specifically; it is one of the ways this gate silently stops
    running while still appearing wired.

    NAMED LIVE SPECIMEN. On 2026-08-06, `ad2cacbb2` added a second
    `Release CI-status preflight contract` step to `ci.yml`'s `release-contracts` job,
    duplicating the one `b2ede54ea` had already added — but the earlier copy carries
    `GH_TOKEN` and the new one does not. In staging run `31213083385` the unauthenticated
    copy failed 17 of its 41 cases (`gh: To use GitHub CLI in a GitHub Actions workflow,
    set the GH_TOKEN environment variable`), which aborted the whole job before its
    `Dashboard e2e backend contract` step ran. So on the very run where two other jobs
    were red on a missing backend requirement, the guard that detects exactly that had
    not executed.

    WHY A DUPLICATE IS ALWAYS WRONG HERE, NOT MERELY SUSPICIOUS. Two steps with one name
    are indistinguishable in the Actions log, so a reader cannot tell which one failed
    without opening the raw text. More importantly a duplicate is the signature of a fix
    applied *by addition* rather than by edit: someone noticed the missing token and added
    a corrected step instead of correcting the existing one, leaving the broken original
    in place and running. Probed across every workflow at the time of writing, this was
    the only occurrence, so the rule costs nothing to hold.

    Only steps with an explicit `name:` are compared. Unnamed `uses:` steps legitimately
    repeat (`actions/checkout` in many jobs) and carry no log ambiguity.
