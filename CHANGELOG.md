# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The dashboard `Migrate` screen now reaches all three source providers.** Discovery,
  submit, and status polling drive the real `/1/migrations/{algolia,meilisearch,typesense}`
  routes from one provider descriptor, replacing the Algolia-only compat aliases. A source
  on a loopback or private address renders the outbound-SSRF refusal and names the
  `FJ_ENABLE_MEILISEARCH_PREVIEW_LOOPBACK` / `FJ_ENABLE_TYPESENSE_PREVIEW_LOOPBACK` opt-in
  instead of a generic error. **Known limitation, stated because it affects self-hosted
  sources:** release builds compile the Meilisearch and Typesense loopback admission seams
  out, so those two opt-ins have no effect in a released binary and only Algolia migration
  is end-to-end proven in a browser. Tracked as `MIG-22`; the console is not the defect.
  A translation-report dry-run is still CLI-only (`flapjack migrate preview`).

### Fixed

- Unknown fields in an Algolia migration request body are now rejected instead of silently
  ignored, and migration jobs poll to a terminal state rather than stopping at the first
  non-terminal status.
- Loadtest readiness helpers no longer accept a `200` from a listener they did not launch:
  every live caller now supplies the launched server's log and expected bind address.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-08-06

### Security

- **Fixed a panic in the API key parser on malformed input.** A secured API key whose
  decoded bytes did not fall on a UTF-8 character boundary would panic the request handler.
  Malformed keys are now rejected as `400`. Reachable by any unauthenticated caller and
  present in released binaries — operators should upgrade. Availability only: no key
  material, index data, or credentials were exposed.
- **Route authorization is now fail-closed.** A request path matching no ACL rule was
  previously allowed through to its handler; it is now denied. All 124 currently registered
  route/method pairs were swept before the flip, and none changed behavior.
- **Admin credentials are no longer accepted in the query string.** Admin-ACL routes read
  the key only from the `x-algolia-api-key` header, keeping admin keys out of server logs,
  shell history, and proxy access logs. Search-scoped keys keep query-string support, so
  browser and InstantSearch clients are unaffected.
- **Analytics no longer persist full client IP addresses.** Addresses are coarsened before
  the Parquet write — IPv4 to /24, IPv6 to /48. Existing Parquet files remain readable;
  historical data is not rewritten.
- **The Docker image runs as a non-root user.** Fixed `flapjack:flapjack` at UID/GID
  `10001:10001`, with image-time `/data` ownership. The numeric identity is pinned so
  base-image upgrades cannot silently shift ownership of persisted volumes. The container
  now exits non-zero with an actionable message when a pre-existing `/data` volume is not
  writable, instead of starting and failing later.
- **The bundled dashboard no longer ships the known Axios production vulnerability.** Its
  Axios dependency floor is now `^1.18.0`.
- The embedded dashboard, API, Swagger UI, and generated error responses now receive a
  strict default security-header set, including CSP frame protection; HSTS remains tied to
  the separate TLS-listener work.
- Request handling now has configurable execution timeout, queued global concurrency, and
  panic-to-JSON containment boundaries, so timeout and panic paths preserve the canonical
  JSON error shape.
- Security audit events now cover admin authentication and sensitive mutations across API
  keys, index deletion, settings changes, snapshot import and restore, S3 restore, and
  admin-key rotation. Events use bounded actor/action/target/outcome fields and route
  templates so credentials, headers, query strings, and raw payloads are not logged.
- S3 snapshot uploads now request server-side encryption by default with `AES256`, can opt
  into `aws:kms` through `FLAPJACK_S3_SSE`, and verify the returned encryption header
  instead of trusting the request.
- Portable snapshot bytes now support optional AES-256-GCM-SIV encryption through
  `FLAPJACK_SNAPSHOT_KEY_FILE`, with encrypted imports requiring the matching key before
  restore.
- **The binary can terminate TLS and hot-rotate ACME material without restarting.** Static
  PEM startup still fails closed when material is unreadable, malformed, incomplete, or
  mismatched. ACME issuance now persists the private key, publishes each fullchain/key pair
  as one owner-private fsynced generation, and updates subsequent rustls handshakes in the
  running listener without rebinding or changing the process. Malformed renewal material
  keeps the last valid certificate live. Plaintext HTTP-01 challenges remain reachable on
  the TLS listener while other plaintext API requests remain rejected. Reverse-proxy TLS
  remains supported.
- **Replication peers now authenticate with their own credential instead of the admin key.**
  Internal routes resolve to one peer-allowed-or-admin-only decision per method and path,
  so a configured peer credential can serve replication while being refused on
  `POST /internal/cluster/peers`, `DELETE /internal/cluster/peers/{node_id}`, and
  `POST /internal/rotate-admin-key`. The credential is read only from the request header and
  compared in constant time. Admin-key and unauthenticated behavior are unchanged, so a
  rolling upgrade needs no coordinated cutover. ~~Two limits remain: the peer credential is
  optional, so replication configured without one keeps the previous posture, and peer
  transport is still cleartext HTTP.~~ **Both limits are closed — see the next entry.**
- **A replication peer must now have a credential, and that credential is not sent in the
  clear by accident.** Two behavior changes, both fail-closed. (1) A node configured with
  replication peers but no `FLAPJACK_REPLICATION_API_KEY` now **refuses to start** instead of
  silently falling back to the previous posture. (2) A peer origin using cleartext `http://`
  is **refused** whenever a credential would travel over it — across static config, persisted
  config, bootstrap peers, and the runtime `POST /internal/cluster/peers` endpoint — with an
  actionable error naming the peer and the fix. Set
  `FLAPJACK_ALLOW_CLEARTEXT_REPLICATION_PEERS=1` to keep a cleartext peer deliberately (for
  example a trusted private LAN); the refusal message names this escape hatch. Background
  analytics rollup fan-out, which was previously an unauthenticated peer client, now
  authenticates with the same credential. **This is a breaking configuration change for
  anyone running replication without a peer credential or over `http://`** — the rolling
  upgrade path is documented in `engine/docs2/3_IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONS.md`.
- **The S3 snapshot list path now fails loudly.** `list_snapshots` checks the ListObjectsV2
  HTTP status before parsing the response body, so a rejected list returns the status
  (`S3 list: HTTP 403`) instead of a misleading XML parse error. Upload and delete already
  did this; all three now have focused rejected-response regressions.
- **The dashboard no longer stores its admin key in browser-readable storage.** Login
  exchanges the key once for a server-owned `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` session cookie;
  logout revokes the session server-side, authenticated reloads survive, and legacy
  persisted key material is dropped during store migration. The durable session store
  persists only keyed fingerprints and per-session salted HMAC-SHA256 verifiers in a
  `0600` file — never the session token or admin key. Header-key authentication for SDKs
  and direct API clients is unchanged.

### Reliability

- **Durable admission stays fail-closed under disk exhaustion.** When the write path's disk fills,
  admission rejects the write with HTTP `500` and no rejected write replays into the index after a
  restart. Re-proved by three sequential real-filesystem fill-disk specimens at exact fetched
  `origin/main` SHA `3b11f8216f1d7dccc74262e1b63b3e1603152202`, each accepted with `outcome=PASS`,
  `acknowledged_count=28`, `recovered_count=28`, `rejection_status=500`, and a `source_sha` equal
  to that SHA. Receipt:
  the reviewed private dur1 respecimen and close receipt.

### Fixed (durability and correctness)

- **`looking-similar` recommendations no longer return an empty result solely because
  vector search is unavailable.** Published targets now use vector similarity when an
  embedder is configured and a content/term-similarity fallback otherwise, with no model
  download or new runtime dependency. Legitimate empty vector answers keep their original
  strategy instead of being silently replaced.
- **The dashboard is usable across all 23 authenticated routes at a 390px viewport.** The
  shared shell, header, and API logger now contain their content without document-level
  horizontal overflow; the route audit reports 23 tested and 23 usable, with a negative
  control proving the overflow oracle fails on the former layout.
- **Runtime HA membership can be managed from the Cluster screen.** Operators can add a
  peer and remove one behind a node-scoped confirmation dialog. Served browser tests verify
  both mutations through the runtime cluster-status API and restore the fixture to zero
  peers after cleanup.
- **A write rejected to the client can no longer become visible after restart, including
  when the oplog append itself fails partway.** Previously the durable-acknowledgement
  guarantee was proven only for failures around the append; it is now proven for a failure
  *inside* `append_operations_with_task_id`, after a partial task-tagged row has been flushed
  and synced but before the sequence counter advances — the exact shape an `EIO`/`ENOSPC`
  takes. The contract admits exactly two honest outcomes: the client sees failure and nothing
  replays, or the client sees a durable acknowledgement and the documents are there. Rollback
  stays owned by the existing write-queue compensation path; no second rollback owner exists.
- **Analytics overview no longer aggregates across every index when one index is
  requested.** `GET /2/overview?index=<name>` returned figures blended across all indexes;
  it now aggregates only the requested index.
- **Bulk-replace uploads now have a route-specific, finite execution deadline.** The global
  request timeout could terminate a measured 1-million-record upload before durable spool
  EOF; the route now receives six times the configured timeout (1,800 seconds by default),
  while focused regressions prove slow clients remain bounded and other routes retain the
  global deadline.
- **Scale-ladder readiness no longer accepts an unrelated listener's HTTP 200.** Its health
  wait now requires the launched server's log to confirm the expected bind address before
  proceeding.
- **`flapjack migrate` auto-port startup failures now reap their child process.** Failed
  startup no longer leaves a listener behind to poison subsequent real-server CLI tests.

### Added

- Resume for interrupted Algolia migration jobs:
  `POST /1/migrations/{provider}/{job_id}/resume` claims a job whose pre-publication export
  was interrupted, using fresh request-only credentials that are never persisted, logged, or
  echoed. Positive status now carries `resumable`, `operation`, and `resumeHandle`. An
  interrupted job inherits its original `expires_at` retention deadline. Continuation is
  exactly-once across a full process restart. Meilisearch and Typesense resume are not
  supported.

- Provider-neutral source index discovery: `POST /1/migrations/{provider}/list-indexes` is
  mounted and published in the OpenAPI document for all three public providers (`algolia`,
  `meilisearch`, `typesense`), returning one shared response shape. Previously only the
  Algolia-shaped discovery path existed; the legacy Algolia route is preserved.
- Meilisearch and Typesense migrations now have served landed-data coverage through real,
  digest-pinned source containers and an authenticated Flapjack server, including exact
  source-ID-to-`objectID` projections and searchable field values. Meilisearch 1.50's default
  `attributeRank` rule now maps to Algolia's single `attribute` criterion, while its default
  `wordPosition` rule is omitted with a warning and unknown or custom rule shapes fail closed.
- Runtime HA membership management: `POST /internal/cluster/peers` adds a peer and
  `DELETE /internal/cluster/peers/{node_id}` removes one, both admin-gated, so cluster
  membership changes no longer require a restart.
- Dead-node auto-heal as a bounded, default-off engine capability
  (`FLAPJACK_AUTOHEAL_ENABLED=true`). The engine evicts at most one sustained-unreachable
  peer after a fixed three-observation threshold, only while the local quorum guard holds,
  readmits returning healthy peers through startup catch-up, and records every refusal,
  eviction, and readmission in `${FLAPJACK_DATA_DIR}/autoheal_decisions.jsonl`.
  `autoheal_enabled` and `autoheal_peers` are reported on admin-only
  `/internal/cluster/status`.
- Official Helm chart for multi-node deployment (`deploy/helm/flapjack/`) with a
  StatefulSet and automatic peer wiring.
- Published operations consumer contract for `/health`, `/internal/status`,
  `/internal/cluster/status`, and `/internal/snapshots/capability`
  (`engine/docs2/operations_consumer_contract.md`), so external operators have a stable,
  documented shape to build against.
- Admin-authenticated atomic bulk-replace job API:
  `POST /1/migrations/bulk-replace?indexName=...` streams NDJSON through the durable
  migration spool and publishes one replacement generation atomically, with durable status
  and cooperative cancellation at `/1/migrations/bulk-replace/{jobID}`. It is node-local
  only; admission returns `503 migration_ha_unsupported` when replication peers are
  configured.
- `flapjack migrate` operator CLI for one-time migration from Algolia, Meilisearch, or
  Typesense: submit, poll durable status, cancel, and acknowledge from the command line.
  `--source-provider <algolia|meilisearch|typesense>` selects the route and defaults to
  `algolia`; Algolia takes `--app-id`, while Meilisearch and Typesense take
  `--source-endpoint`, sent as `endpoint` and `node` respectively. Source and destination
  credentials are accepted only through `--*-env`, `--*-file`, or `--*-stdin` — never as
  argv — so keys stay out of help text, shell history, and process listings; the original
  `--algolia-key-{env,file,stdin}` spellings remain as aliases of the provider-neutral
  `--source-key-*` flags. Distinct non-zero exit codes classify configuration, transport,
  and terminal-job failures.
- Cooperative cancellation for asynchronous migration jobs, with owner-identity enforcement
  and a `409` for cancel requests that arrive too late to take effect.
- Algolia replica topology is carried through migration: replicas named by the source
  primary are created as settings-only virtual sidecars whose sort order resolves at query
  time, with the remaining fidelity limits surfaced as explicit migration warnings.
- Daily usage snapshots now persist the two usage gauges, so the historical series survives
  restarts.
- The migration API now declares one closed `source_provider` union (`algolia`,
  `meilisearch`, `typesense`) with provider-parameterised routes at
  `/1/migrations/{provider}` and matching OpenAPI paths. Meilisearch and Typesense HTTP
  migration adapters now submit through the shared durable async lifecycle. Preview is
  supported for Algolia, Meilisearch, and Typesense; Typesense preview preserves its
  provider-specific settings translation report. Non-Algolia resume continues to fail
  closed with stable `source_provider_unsupported` errors.

### Changed

- Oversized ingestion requests now return HTTP `413 Payload Too Large` instead of `400 Bad Request` for both per-document (`DocumentTooLarge`) and per-batch (`BatchTooLarge`) size-limit rejections, letting ingestion clients distinguish "chunk and retry" from a malformed request.
- Authenticated asynchronous Algolia migration now supports fenced
  `overwrite=true` replacement through the same crash-safe publication owner as
  the synchronous path.
- Successful asynchronous migration status now carries durable settings,
  synonym, rule, and warning outcomes; running, failed, and cancelled jobs omit
  those outcomes instead of presenting fabricated zeroes.
- The repaired single-machine scale contract now proves 1,000,000 compact and
  1,000,000 standard records through every frozen correctness, liveness,
  locality, evidence, and text-search latency gate. The July 25 latency/count
  failures remain immutable historical evidence rather than the current
  Guaranteed result.
- Node-local bulk replacement now owns bulk-only writer-buffer and document
  checkpoint knobs, and the scale projector accepts bulk-build throughput probe
  evidence only under the existing reference-locality gate.
- The node-local bulk-build writer buffer (20,000,000 bytes) and document
  checkpoint interval (1,000 documents) are frozen at the behavior-preserving
  baseline with a recorded local-locality gate measurement. Raising the
  bulk-only budget requires a reference-locality (`i4i.4xlarge` NVMe) sweep,
  which is a paid AWS scale run deferred to the named successor "paid reference
  ladder" batch; no new capacity or throughput claim is published.

### Fixed

- Explicit empty arrays (`[]`) in customer document fields are now preserved on write instead of being dropped, keeping customer-supplied content intact.
- Staged bulk builds now await their write worker and Tantivy merge threads before
  validation, settled-metrics capture, or publication.
- Write-admission backpressure no longer pauses a tenant whose live segment count
  settles into the staged-bulk range. The selected settled segment band now spans
  both measured regimes (online and staged bulk), so a large bulk build that settles
  above the online shape is no longer treated as an unhealthy segment ceiling.
- Async replacement now survives cancel/failure boundaries and idempotent owner
  ACK replay without leaving the replaced target in an indeterminate
  publication state.
- S3 snapshot deletion and retention failures now propagate their HTTP status instead of
  being ignored; `snapshot_to_s3` returns a sanitized `500` when retention cleanup fails.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Dashboard `/dashboard/` now serves the embedded dashboard HTML instead of returning 404.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Dashboard `/cluster` now presents standalone replication status as a healthy single-node state with explicit reassurance copy for operators who are not running HA peers.
- Dashboard `/events` now labels the failed-event status filter as `Failed`, reducing confusion with runtime page errors while preserving the underlying `error` status value.
- Dashboard `/index/:indexName` result-row delete actions now expose document-specific accessible names such as `delete document <objectID>`, restoring screen-reader context for icon-only controls.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-04

<!-- Promoted from [Unreleased] by Stage 3 CUT_V108 release drain. -->

### Fixed

- Documentation: refreshed install pin examples from stale `v0.2.0`/`v0.1.0` to current `v1.0.7` in `engine/install.sh` (lines 7 and 169) and propagated the repo-wide grep discipline; see Lane B Stage 3 propagation decisions bundle.

### Added

- README: added 7-question evaluator FAQ section covering Algolia API compatibility, multi-tenancy, write throughput, InstantSearch.js support, licensing, HMAC-scoped keys, and the migration endpoint; refreshed Known limitations phrasing for public readability.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Public install docs now describe the current installer contract: no argument resolves the latest release, while `sh -s -- <version>` pins an explicit release. The stale `v0.2.0` example was replaced with a current `v1.0.7` pin before release-cut validation.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Nightly SDK e2e jobs now wait for full readiness (`/health/ready`) in addition to liveness (`/health`) before exercising the server, eliminating the C# `InitializeAsync` flake whose root cause was that `engine/tests/common/wait_for_flapjack.sh` polls liveness only and the gap to readiness could exceed the C# SDK's 2s `ConnectTimeout`. A readiness curl is now appended after every `wait_for_flapjack.sh` invocation in `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` (dashboard-all, sdk-php-all, sdk-python-all, sdk-go-e2e, sdk-ruby-all, sdk-java-all, sdk-csharp-all), and the C# SDK's default `ConnectTimeout` was raised from `2000ms` to `5000ms` to provide a defense-in-depth margin for cold-start TCP accept jitter.
- Concurrent admin-key rotations are now serialized with a per-store mutex, preventing a race where two simultaneous `/1/keys/rotate` requests could leave the on-disk `.admin_key` file and in-memory key value inconsistent. The file-first/memory-second write ordering is preserved; the mutex only gates entry to `rotate_admin_key()`.
- Snapshot export and import filesystem walks now run on a blocking thread via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` (`engine/flapjack-http/src/handlers/snapshot.rs`), preventing tokio worker starvation under concurrent multi-tenant write load that produced an intermittent restore document-count mismatch in the `snapshot_export_under_load` CI gate.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Test-environment shim now injects `AuthenticatedAppId` into the `test_stage4_sdk_smoke` Router via the canonical `apply_test_app_id_layer` helper, restoring the `ab_lifecycle_smoke` and `insights_to_analytics_full_lifecycle_smoke` regression gates that v1.0.4's idempotency rewrite (scoping by `AuthenticatedAppId`) left red. The production auth middleware always supplies the extension at runtime, so the v1.0.4 binary's customer-facing behavior was correct; this release re-greens the integration-test signal that protects against future regressions in the auth-scoped idempotency path.
- HA contracts `c3_replica_freshness` and `c4_restart_recovery` are CI-stabilized: the mirror-CI staging+prod failures observed on every push since the v1.0.4 sync were CI-environment-specific (resource-constrained runners, parallel test execution) rather than HA-mode behavior regressions. The tests now hold under both developer and constrained-CI environments, restoring the per-tenant catch-up and restart-recovery gates that protect HA deployments from real future regressions.
- PL-10 sustained-write saturation acceptance harness (`engine/loadtest/tests/pl10_saturation_acceptance.sh`) gate semantics were redesigned so the `FLAPJACK_WRITE_QUEUE_BATCH_SIZE` operator-tunable batching knob is legitimately distinguished from the baseline configuration. The prior gate could not fire under the shipped load profile because both configurations passed the absolute saturation threshold; the redesigned gate now produces a deterministic `TUNABLE_VERIFIED` outcome, restoring the harness as a real correctness mechanism for operators tuning batch size.
- HA test-hygiene sweep closed the LEAKY_PASS sites surfaced by the v1.0.4 snapshot-flake verification — dangling tokio tasks, `TempDir` lifecycle gaps, and adjacent test-helper leaks in `test_replication` and `make_test_app_state_wires_manager_dictionary_and_defaults` — preventing test-suite hygiene debt from masking real HA regressions in future releases.
- `flapjack-http` snapshot-install path-traversal test now uses the single-call `.expect_err("error tuple expected")` form (replacing the chained `.err().expect()`) to satisfy the staging linux x86_64 `clippy::err_expect` lint under `-D warnings`, re-greening the nightly clippy lane that had been red at the v1.0.4 tag.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Dashboard `DocumentCard` collapsed previews now apply deterministic remainder-field ordering before the six-field cutoff, preventing key fields such as `brand` from intermittently dropping behind lower-priority fields.
- `flapjack-server` now accepts the standard `--version` flag (e.g. `docker run ghcr.io/flapjackhq/flapjack:<next> --version` prints the version). The flag was missing from the clap derive metadata; landed on `main` after the v1.0.3 tag was cut, so it ships in 1.0.4.
- The Docker entrypoint now treats flag-only invocations (e.g. `--version`) as `flapjack` arguments instead of attempting to exec them as a binary. Same release window as above — landed on `main` after the v1.0.3 tag was cut.
- Startup catch-up snapshot installs now expose stable `sub_step` tags for failing restore branches and harden the staging/activation rename path against transient filesystem races during snapshot remediation.
- Node-local idempotency durability is now persisted at `${FLAPJACK_DATA_DIR}/_idempotency/cache.db`, with restart replay preserving single-execution semantics for repeated idempotency keys.
- Write-queue batching is tuned via `FLAPJACK_WRITE_QUEUE_BATCH_SIZE` with a default commit threshold of `32`, so commit batching follows the canonical runtime seam instead of per-operation flush behavior.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-05-30

### Changed (BREAKING)

- The `vector-search-local` feature (local embedding via `fastembed` → `ort` → `tokenizers` → `hf-hub`) is no longer enabled by default for the `flapjack`, `flapjack-http`, and `flapjack-server` crates. Consumers that need local embedding must build with `--features vector-search-local` (or `--features vector-search` for usearch-only without local model inference). This brings the baseline `cargo build` / `cargo test` graph under the runner disk budget that previously exhausted CI; the heavy embedding chain remains exercised by the explicit `--features vector-search` CI jobs.

### Fixed

- HTTP delete endpoints now return a bounded retriable `503` on accepting-node restart instead of hanging the request indefinitely (completes the PL-13 ack-on-durable contract for the delete path). The new `delete_documents_durable` seam mirrors the add-path's bounded-durable semantics; delete callers in `flapjack-http`'s `objects/batch.rs`, `objects/mod.rs`, and `replicas.rs` are routed through it.
- Task eviction (`evict_old_tasks` in the index manager) now skips non-terminal (`Enqueued`/`Processing`) tasks. Previously, an in-flight write under ≥1000 tasks/tenant overload could be evicted before the durable-ack poll observed its terminal status, producing a spurious `TaskNotFound`/`5xx` for a write that may still have committed. Eviction now waits for the task to reach a terminal state before reclaiming.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- HTTP batch-write endpoints now return 200 only after Tantivy commit durability (ack-on-durable). Previously, writes were acknowledged upon queue enqueue, meaning a write-queue task crash between enqueue and commit silently lost acknowledged documents. Implements ADR-0005 Option C with bounded durable-ack polling (default 30s, configurable via `FLAPJACK_WRITE_DURABLE_TIMEOUT_MS`). Queue-full returns 429, commit-failure and ack-timeout return 503, all with `Retry-After: 1`. Measured 120.7x single-doc write throughput reduction vs fire-and-forget baseline — the accepted durability-over-throughput tradeoff; batching via realistic-batch patterns (1,483 docs/sec) remains within typical Algolia-migrator requirements.

### Changed

- Stage 6 sustained-load revalidation documented two overload scenarios at `921.538969/s` and `831.652577/s`; each preserved contract health (`write_http_5xx_rate=0.00%`, `write_http_unexpected_4xx_rate=0.00%`) while saturation remained visible (`85.04%` and `98.21%` write-failure rates).
- Rolling-restart HA behavior improved to a steady-state `0.88%` per-node spread while maintaining availability, narrowing the prior convergence boundary.
- Known residual limits: sustained-write saturation under overload (PL-10), cross-node idempotency-cache durability (ADR-0005 OQ2), and replication-boundary convergence (ADR-0004). Restart-window write loss is resolved by the ack-on-durable fix above.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- Release publishing now builds and publishes Linux amd64 and arm64 Docker candidate images on separate per-architecture paths before stable tag promotion.
- Stable `ghcr.io/griddlehq/flapjack:<version>` and `:latest` Docker tags are now promoted only from a candidate manifest that passed required architecture checks.
